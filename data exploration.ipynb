It was great to be able to open windows when we craved fresh rather than heated air. The beds, including the fold out sofa bed, were comfortable and the rooms were cleaned well. Wi-fi access worked like a dream with only one connectivity issue on our first night and this was promptly responded to with a call from the service provider to ensure that all was well.

Plenty of closet space, well lit with floor to ceiling windows, and actually quiet!\\nThe bathroom was large with a very nice walk-in shower and a built-in bench with unique low spout to wash your feet.\\nThe kitchenette was a nice touch with a stocked fridge offering complimentary non-alcoholic beverages and snacks, dishes and utensils, a sink, dishwasher, and a microwave. \\nThey have daily Happy Hour(s) where you can get a complimentary decent glass of wine in the modest Lobby Lounge and bring it to your room. The Lobby Lounge has some seating and one table with 8 or so chairs where you can buy food from the adjacent restaurant. One suggestion is to offer selections of cheese and crackers platters to go with that wine. We ordered one that had to be custom made, but it worked well. \\nWe didn\\'t eat in the hotel restaurants. The restaurant off the lobby was very pricey for breakfast (+$20 per entree).

       "  'text': \"I have stayed at each of the US Andaz properties, and this one is the best of them all. MUCH better than the West Hollywood property where Brand standards are slowly fading. This is the shining star here in the States.\\nMy room (suite) on the 12th floor was fantastic as usual. Perfectly maintained, very comfortable, great bathrooms (best in NYC???). The bathroom is huge, with large shower 'room' and multiple shower heads. Double lavatories flank one wall. Huge....\\nTHe bed is always perfect. Televisions in both rooms were perfect for my limited time spend in the suite. Nice desk for work area and in room dining. \\nEvery room has a fridge with complimentary soft drinks, snacks, water, sparkling water, milk and juices. Nice touch. Suite has full size refrigerator with icemaker, and also features a microwave, sink and dishwasher drawer....all nicely concealed behind beautiful cabinetry. Really great for a longer stay...\\nI do have 2 complaints. First, the elevators. The waits were sometimes ridiculous. 3 elevators serve the main tower with a rather limited number of rooms. THis is a newer hotel, but there is no service elevator. I was continually surprised after waiting for an elevator at how many stops we made for housekeeping to enter with carts, room service carts and trays, etc. How could Hyatt skip a service elevator on this new property? It really stinks at times.....its bad.\\nLastly, i have traveled with world and certainly know NYC pricing. Breakfast at the Andaz ranks above almost anything i have ever paid. Apparently, i had a $190.00 breakfast for two the first morning, and $175.00 the second. Eggs for each, coffee, berries. Wow. Of course, i really don't know...as there is no bill. They just deliver it, and leave. Prices are listed in the in-suite menu, but no itemized billing is given. I am 'gifted' with a $75.00 credit for my breakfast as a Diamond member, and i assumed that had not been applied when my bill reflected a 'non itemized' charge for $110 plus for the first night, and slightly less for the second. I was wrong, it had been applied (no way for me to see this). WOW. It certainly isn't worth it.\\nI know i sound like one of those guys who complains about pricing, but clearly doesn't know what things cost. Wrong. This one really surprised me, and i have traveled the world for more than 20 years staying in some of the finest hotels in the world. Andaz is great, but it doesn't rank with many that i have had the pleasure of staying with.\\nI just had breakfast this morning for 2 at the Four Seasons NYC. It was half the cost....almost. :)\\nStay away from room service in my opinion....\",\n",

We arrived at the hotel very late at night but our check-in was very easy and just like many other reviewers we got upgraded to a suite.\\nWe fell in love with the decor. It is just like the photos in the hotel website. The lobby smelled lovely with their signature scent. It was even lovelier when mixed with the fresh coffee smell in the morning. \\nBeds were extremely comfortable. Books in the room were a nice touch. We had two bathrooms after our upgrade which we appreciated a lot. The bathrooms were really very chic and the TOTO toilets were something! \\nThe housekeeping service was really good with turn-down service.\\nWe had drinks at the Lambs Club bar nearly every night with our friends and were very happy with everything. We had dinner at the Lambs Club restaurant downstairs and were very pleased. We did not have breakfast at the hotel as there are a lot of alternatives close by.\\nMy husband had a couple of pre-arranged deliveries and the concierge were very helpful with them. We thank Mr Mullins for all his help. We never saw our butler during our 9 night stay, therefore I cannot comment on the butler service, but we did not really need it anyway. \\nOverall a great 5-star boutique hotel experience in a very central NYC location.',\n",

We found it a perfect base to explore all Manhattan has to offer. Walking to Central Park took approximately 20 minutes, Times Square was less than 5 minutes away and with close Subway stations access to all of Manhattan is a piece of cake.\\nWith regard the hotel itself, we were very happy with out choice. Location aside, the hotel was very clean and well appointed. We had a room on the 11th floor, and after sending the hotel an email prior to our arrival they provided a room with a view of the Chrysler Building, as requested.\\nThe room itself was a decent size, tidy bathroom with powerful shower and Molton Brown products. The hotel has two lifts servicing all floor, and we never had to wait for a lift. Both the concierge and the front desk staff were very helpful and courteous, as were the bell boys. A wonderful little touch was the urn in the reception area. In the morning it was full of coffee, with cups available for you to take out with you. And from the afternoon onwards, hot cider was available. \\nVery happy with our choice and won't hesitate to return the next time we visit New York.\",\n",

Hotel is a few minutes walk from Rockefeller center and 5th avenue. The subway is right on your door. Only slight critique would be the night life tends to close around 11pm in the immediate area. Very minor issue as we were not in New York to get drunk. Breakfast was basic but perfectly acceptable, lovely fresh continental breakfast, decent coffee, fruit juices, yoghurts. You can eat as much as you like and grab a coffee before you head into New York. The door staff were great, they found us a taxi at rush hour in the rain which in NYC isn't the easiest thing to do.\\nThe only problem we had was that our safe was not working when we arrived, (battery was duff) but this was fixed within 20 mins.\\nOverall, no complaints, would definitely return again.\",\n",

I'm not sure exactly how they are more family friendly than any other hotel except for the suites and kitchenettes for budget-conscious families. There weren't any special programs for kids, but we did see other families there. For NYC, a nice sized Queen suite gave us everything we needed. Didn't use the kitchen for our overnight stay but definitely would in the future. Rooms were comfortable (ok... a little tight at the foot of the bed but not like some complaints described), the amenities were really appreciated, e.g., free wifi, Keurig coffee service in room, desk area, energy efficient rooms (you put your room card in a device that controls the electricity to save energy while you're out). Lovely bathrooms (although they need a hand towel holder), but really comfortable. We are a family of 3 so the kiddo slept on the pull-out sofa. Room was in good condition-- it appears that shade of green must be the theme, but its nice. The bellman held our luggage after checkout to allow us to stay in the city and not have to worry about our bags. Parking garage is right around the corner -- very close. Viand diner downstairs was OK for dinner -- not great but sufficient. Friendly front desk folks were really helpful -- have breakfast at Bagel Talk not too far away. Very convenient to American Museum of Natural History -- easy to catch a cab or subway. We will definitely stay here again and very happy to recommend.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I was lucky enough to use my Hyatt two free nights to stay at this hotel in early December. Went with my adult daughter and we stayed in a corner room with two twin beds on the ninth floor. It\\'s tough to find good hotels with two beds in a room in NYC so this was a bonus. The room was very quiet. I could not hear anyone from other rooms, the hallway or any street noise. The room has a sleek modern design and was spacious for NYC standards. I loved the bathroom. Being able to get a cold bottle of water at all times was great and snacks in the rooms was a nice touch.\\nI also loved the overall vibe of the hotel; small, hip, clean, and friendly. Great artwork. Not warm and cozy though. The seating in the \"lobby\" is not particularly comfortable or inviting. The staff was young and not as experienced as one would find at a five-star hotel but this is not a five-star hotel. They did the best they could to help with restaurant reservations, shopping information and other general information. Easy walk from here to Grand Central Station to hop the subway and cabs easy to find. Loved being across from The New York Pubic Library and Bryant Park. Lovely pop-up stores and ice skating in Bryant Park for the holidays. Beats the craziness of Rockefeller Center in my book. \\nThere are a few problems that I believe can be corrected easily. One is the lack of proper lighting in the room, the architect and designers clearly were not thinking of women when they designed the rooms. It is very dark and would be really difficult if you were trying to get ready for a special event. Also there is no drawer space and the closet is minuscule. Not sure how to correct that issue. The other problem is that the beds, at least the twins we slept in, were not very comfortable. Very firm which is fine if you like it that way. All in all though, my memories are of a great stay.',\n",

Not only is the 5th Avenue property in a great location, but the rooms are wonderfully designed and well appointed and the staff does a great job in terms of customer service. My wife and I arrived at 10am on a Saturday morning and the hotel had been sold out the night before. However, the young lady checked us in quickly and asked for a phone number to call us when our room was ready. We went out to have breakfast and before we were finished she call to let me know that the room was ready. We also loved the complimentary snacks and beverages in the mini frig, as well as in the lounge. The only drawback is that the Internet is painstakingly slow, which is the reaso for the 4 stars. Except for that, the hotel is a 5 all around. Would definitely recommend highly.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Just returned from a 4 day/3 night long weekend in NYC with wife and two (late teenage) sons. We stayed at The Setai and loved it. The rooms are surprisingly large for NY and beautifully appointed. All the staff were outstanding in their courtesy and helpfulness and the location is pretty good too!\\nA few tips:\\n* We all preferred to take breakfast in our rooms. For some reason it was just a better experience than the restaurant.\\n* Do use the concierge for tickets, restaurant and visitor recommendations. Everything they suggested worked perfectly and they enhanced our stay hugely.\\n* Don't be afraid to walk and when I say walk I mean stroll. Take your time, look around and you'll be surprised how easy it is to get to places on foot. Empire State Building is insanely close by, Madison Square Garden a short walk beyond that. Rockerfeller Center, Broadway and Times Square make an easy and fun circular route and you can stroll up 5th Avenue to Central Park and beyond quite easily.\\n* Subways are a nightmare to find if you're used to the clear signposting in London or Paris but once you done it once or twice you'll get the hang of it. The Setai is no more than a block or two in any direction from the subway.\\n* Taxis are a law unto themselves. You have been warned.\\nSo....The Setai is just about as good as you can get in Mid-Town and every one of us would go back in an instant if we could. Enjoy!\",\n",

You have to walk a few steps and get into a hall which is essentially a bar (so noisy during happy hours that you have to scream to be able to talk to the receptionist). I was given a room on the 9th floor with an annoying noise in the air conditioning system. I changed room and given another one with the same problem and an extremely narrow window looking into a shaft. I was promised a better room the following day but, when I checked the following morning, the lady at the reception said that no room was available and the person I had spoken to was not on duty at the time. I was told to check again later and I responded that if no other room was available I would check out. I got back and, after unpleasant negotiations with a manager, I was promised a better room for the following day. I went to my room, thought about it a few minutes, went back down and said I would check out. At that point I was told that since it was by then past noon I was to pay for the room anyway! Upon my protest, I was allowed to check out without paying for the additional night. Incidentally, the rooms are dark, the furniture is pretentiously stylish but in reality of very poor design and covered with dark brown plastic material. The pool is a joke: the size of four bath tubs! Finally, there is no quiet area where you can just sit down in an armchair and chat with a friend. In my view, the place is grossly overrated.\",\n",

The location is also hard to beat being close to broadway, the subway and reasonably close to Central Park. Price seemed reasonable for the location but the room was a bit smaller than what we would have liked (couple + 6 yr old) and with three suitcases we had to place one on the floor near the door since there was no where else to put it. Prices for food and services seemed a little steep (not sure how they compare with other hotels in the city) but we found a diner only a few doors down which had good food at good prices. Hotel would suit a couple who only intend to use it as a base and don't intend spending much time there but being in NYC that's not hard to do. A positive experience overall.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I arrived around 8:30 p.m., calling ahead to tell the hotel when to expect me and found no doorman and no help with luggage to unload or go up the steps with my bags. A stranger did it for me! Once checked in, an employee decided to show me to the room with me trailing along with my luggage and holding the door to the elevator for him. I finally told him to take the luggage. Once in the room I was told that I was not allowed to adjust the temperature of the room on the thermostat. When I asked about the window heating/AC unit, he proceeded to fiddle with it. I told him to be sure that it was off. He lied and said it was off. It was not off. I later had to get the engineer to turn it completely off as the prior employee had activated a timer that was cycling it on and off. There is no lighting in the closet or for that whole end of the room where I was attempting to unpack. I took the minimum out of my bag for fear of losing the other things in the dark. All wall plugs are completely filled with the hotel\\'s stuff. I had to get down on my hands and knees to find a strip plug underneath the desk for my IPad to charge. Then I found an outlet on the side of the desk for my IPhone to charge. However, to my dismay the next morning I found that when I turned off the desk light, the desk plug also went dead and my phone did NOT charge overnight. The mattress was good and that is why this hotel received three stars instead of two. Now, the shower: I scalded my right arm turning off the shower because there are absolutely NO markings on the shower as where hot, cold or off is. I recommend that you step outside the tub/shower before turning it off and be sure not to have any part of you under the water when turning it off. There is no ventilation in the bathroom. Therefore, not only was the bathroom completely steamed, which ruined my hair, but also the bedroom windows. As to the so-called BAY window in my room: The top half of the windows is completely blacked out by the hotel eliminating half the light coming in the windows. And this room really needs more light. In addition, there are dark brown wooden shutters that cannot be lifted, only tilted that further curtail light entering this room. What a dismal swamp it is. Breakfast: there was an argument about whether or not I was allowed to order the continental breakfast, being first told no and later told yes. And then there was the issue with the eggs. Even when I told them how many minutes to boil the eggs, the cook could not do the eggs even half way cooked to wear I asked. Not a good situation, in my opinion. Sleeping: Although the mattress was comfortable, I had to wear earplugs and play a sound soother to sleep well. When the neighboring room turned on its shower, the water sound screamed and bubbled right at the headboard to my bed. I checked out in the AM for a conference, stored my luggage at the hotel and was allowed to use the gym in the late PM to change my shoes for my trip home in the early evening. I am attempting to be fair and point out the good, too. And finally, when I noted some of the deficiencies to the person who originally escorted me to my room his answer was: \"It is What it is.\" Now that I am safely at home, I can laugh at this most ridiculous interpretation of customer service I have ever heard.',\n",

No problem, but it didn't need to take that long. When I finally checked in at 5:30, I was given a handicapped room which just had some interesting things in the bathroom. Otherwise, the bed and pillows were very comfortable and I was impressed that the room had a small refrigerator (in addition to the mini bar), microwave, and a drawer that contained plates and silverware.

To begin with, a wide-angle lens was used to photograph the lobby and sitting area, which together are nothing more than a hallway. \\nFurthermore, an in-room kitchen is pictured among the hotel photos, which lead me to believe that I could expect this amenity. Perhaps that was naïve of me, but I was not mistaken in my understanding that a microwave oven would be available upon request at the time of booking. Therefore, the derision with which the person on the desk met my query came as a shock. She informed me that since I’d only booked a room and not a suite, I couldn’t expect anything, She went on to ask if I thought they had microwaves just lying around. I requested that this rude X-X look into the matter and, 20 minutes later, someone came with the oven. This was my experience of their much vaunted concierge service. \\nAs to it being a “cherished boutique hotel” or a “luxury hotel”, so described on the Sherry-Netherland website, it was shabby and the décor in my room had nothing in particular to recommend it. \\nThen there are the elevator attendants, a number of immigrant men who stand around with very little to keep them occupied. They were a nice enough bunch and I’m glad they have work, but they are somewhat redundant. After all, I can press a button in an elevator without any help. \\nI’ve seen much better hotels that cost much less money. Who ever gave this place 4 ½ stars?\\nYes, I realize that one pays for location and that I rented ‘only’ a room and not a suite but, as a regular visitor to New York, I am never staying at the Sherry- Netherland again.',\n",

The location was great - right across from the Plaza Hotel, the Apple Store, and a stone\\'s throw to the beautiful shops on Fifth Avenue. When I arrived, I was greeted by a friendly concierge. The elevators are operated by \"white-glove elevator attendants\", which felt like a little treat every time I went up or down. My room was everything a girl could want on her first business trip to NYC - a dressing room (!!!) with a plush white robe and ample space to hang things, a Keurig coffee maker with unlimited coffee pods, a chandelier, fresh bouquets of flowers, boxes of Godiva chocolates, and a \"welcome\" card from the hotel manager. Every morning I ordered room service from Cipriani\\'s, the restaurant attached to the hotel. The omlette was delicious, and filling out my breakfast form the night before, and hanging it on my door knob, quickly became a ritual. \\nOne evening the neighbours were making quite a lot of noise, and I called down to the concierge at midnight. Within 10 minutes someone was upstairs to check on the situation, and shortly thereafter things quieted down. Similarly, when I couldn\\'t get the wifi to work, the concierge offered to send up an IT person to help me figure it out. The staff was attentive, and although they had a bit of that brusque NY attitude (different from what Canadians are typically used to), they were extremely helpful. In the evenings, someone would come to turn down the bed, and leave little Godiva chocolate squares throughout the room. They would tidy up the newspapers and clothes in my room, and make sure it looked warm and cozy for when I got home. I loved it, and would not hesitate to go back again.',\n",

We used the laundrette in the hotel and it was clean and well lit - what more could you want.\\nThis is a \"family\" hotel - nice and quiet with a relaxed air about it.

The beacon hotel was a fantastic place to stay with friendly and polite staff who could not do enough for you.\\nThe rooms were modern, spacious and clean and the beds were heaven after a long day walking around manhattan.\\nThe area of the hotel was ideal for us as it allowed us to see many of the New York attractions whilst keeping away from the hustle and bustle that many midtown hotels would experience.\\nThe hotel itself is about a 10 minute walk from Central Park, however a 30/40 minute walk to many midtown attractions eg. Rockafella centre. I would advise the city bus tour which was $54 dollars per person as it allows you to see all of the main tourist attractions and helps you find your bearings (especially first timers)\\nOur overall experience of the beacon hotel and New York as a whole is 10 out of 10.

We had a loft room on the 8th floor; half of the room is an \"office\" (it really is an office!) which they did inform us at check in. The room is really only appropriate for a single business traveler. Only one drawer in the room so I used the office to lay out my suitcase and lived out of the that. Bathroom was roomy and the bed very comfortable. Decor is Japanese sensibility meets European minimalism. The controls for the shower were very challenging--no kidding! City noise does filter in--not bad but bring ear plugs just in case this bothers you. For the most part the staff was very helpful and friendly and attentive. The food here is just excellent (breakfast and room service); I would eat here even if i was not staying here. Entrances, dining areas, lounges are not well marked so you have to guess your way around for a bit. Location is excellent: very close to Grand Central Station and tons of eating and shopping options. I would definitely stay here again but would be more discriminating about the choice of room. Lastly, an observation and not a complaint: no holiday decorations to be found here in the midst of December!',\n",

They were friendly and fun and extra nice to my 12-year old son. They recognized us each time we walked in and out, which made things really great. The great thing that we noticed is that the staff really liked each other and seemed to have a lot of fun working there. We particularly loved the restaurant manager, Tim, who took great care of us and was so funny and attentive to us. \\nOh and it was my birthday so they nicely left us a note and some cupcakes in the room, which was great!\\nThe room was not super big (but I guess this is NYC). Ours had 2 queen beds and not much room for anything else. The one negative was that it was rather dimly lit even when we turned on every last light, but from what I understand this is a green hotel and they are saving on energy and wattage. However, we would have liked to have the room a bit brighter since there was also a lot of woodwork and dark closet doors which also made the room on the dark side even during the day. The beds were extremely comfortable with nice white fluffy duvet comforters and down pillows. There were a lot of outlets and close to the bed (and located on the nightstands) which were great for charging phones and computers.\\nWe were on a high floor with nice views. The rooms with two beds don't face the empire state building, which was a bummer because we hoped to see it from the windows. The hotel is centrally located and we walked from Penn Station and walked to Bryant Park which is beautiful around Christmastime.\\nThe 2nd floor restaurant has a glass ceiling and is open to the sky which is beautiful at night and from what I understand the roof retracts which would be awesome on a summer night (which they said they do). \\nOverall we had a great stay!\",\n",

We went for my 30th birthday and I was given a little present at check in. A big thank you to Neville who sent Champagne, cupcakes and chocolates up as a special treat - what a lovely touch. \\nHotel location is fantastic. Very close to the Empire State - fantastic views from the hotel. We requested a room with a view and they didn't disappoint. We were given a room on the top floor with brilliant views across the city. It's around a 10 min walk to Times Square and very close to the Subway station. Lots of nice restaurants and deli's close by. \\nWIne hour was marvellous! We were really impressed and the bar and atmosphere was delightful. Just what you need after a long day sightseeing. \\nRecommend Tony's restaurant off Times Square if you're looking for a brilliant meal at reasonable prices. The portions are enormous without skimping on quality. The steak special out-did us. Don't think we even ate half!! \\nLoved this hotel. Really really impressed and will definitely go back.

       "  'text': 'The Iroquois is a beautiful hotel. I chose it because of it\\'s location to Times Square & 5th Avenue and because it also got good reviews here. The staff were very professional and always had a smile. The room was clean and cozy. Our suite, #1000, had the most amazing view of Rockefeller Centre. Also, the windows open nice and wide, which was good because the hotel has that stuffy old hotel air, which gives it its charm but also makes it hard to sleep at night. Of course opening the window makes it louder than normal; I brought earplugs. If you are a light sleeper, BRING earplugs to New York! \\nMy husband thought the room was a little small but I thought it was just right. When your on a quick 4 day\\'er, you don\\'t spend any time in it anyway. It had a TV, dresser draws, a little fridge, a good sized bathtub shower and a desk with chair. Pretty standard. \\nUnfortunately, we did not eat in the hotel restaurant but a lady in the elevator told me that it was great. Within a 5 block radius there are plenty of restaurants and Irish Pubs (which happen to be my favourite!), so the hotel ammendities were not that important to me on this trip. There is a good, reasonably priced, family style restaurant at the end of the block called \"the red flame\". Great breakfast diner restaurant for it\\'s price. \\nAs I mentioned, the hotel is close to everything. Don\\'t kid yourself though, if you are in New York to see the sights, you will be walking alot. Bring good shoes. The hotel conceirge was fabulous when it came to giving us directions, especially subway lines, so don\\'t worry about having to navigate it all by yourself. \\nThumbs up Iroquois... we will be back.',\n",

The hotel offers more of a \"residence\" feel than a standard hotel, and the locations is unbeatable - across the street from Central Park, in the heart of Fifth Avenue shopping, and within walking distance to Rockfeller Center and Times Square (if you enjoy walking). We found the hotel quiet and a terrific place to relax in the evening after exploring the city all day and night. We only used the fitness facility once because the weather is perfect for jogs in Central Park instead, but did find it a bit small and outdated compared to other high end hotels. Room service is available at Cipriani downstairs, and we used it for breakfast, which was good - although the breakfast cutoff hours and staff at Cipriani were not ideal - no fault of the Sherry though, as they are not under the same management and operate independently. We loved our stay at the Sherry overall and hope to be back soon!',\n",

And the promise given has not been fulfilled.\\nThe other negative aspect was that we were not provided with advantages as LHW members except for thenice personal letter from the manager. Usually we receive at least some fruits, uograde, free internet or something...\\nThe last negative point was about pre arrival assistance and concierge. We sent some requirements before our arrival but got answer only very late as our email was categorized as spam and the concierge had not chcecked the spam folder. We also had some difficulties with our reservation when in the city and were not able to reach the concierge via phone.

We stayed an unfortunate four nights at this hotel, and suffered major itching, including a major let down from what we were advised BEFORE booking at The Chatwal! We phoned prior to booking to ensure that the hotel had bathtubs (as our personal preference, we only book with hotels which have bathtubs) - we were advised that EVERY room has a bathtub - excellent, so we booked. We arrived all the way from New Zealand (19 hours of flight-time) at approximately 11:00pm to arrive to a major disappointment. NO BATHTUB! We phoned the desk from our room and were advised \"sorry, there\\'s nothing we can do as all rooms with a bathtub are taken\". We then advised that prior to booking we were advised that ALL ROOMS have a bathtub - \"no sorry, you were told wrong, and there\\'s nothing I can do but you are welcome to leave\". Then my husband went downstairs and spoke to the \"duty manager\" who then finally relented and looked up to see who would be checking out the following morning so we could get a room with a bathtub. We were then promised a room with a bathtub by 12:00 midday, but by the next morning, the woman at the desk advised \"sorry, but they are now checking out at 4:00pm\", so we asked for a refund for the first day since the whole inconvenience had ruined a whole entire travel day (WE had been trying to sort out this mess OURSELVES all night long and the following morning by arranging a room with a bathtub) - their reply \"sorry, there\\'s nothing I can do\" - she didn\\'t even offer any complimentary gestures as a way of saying sorry for the inconvenience caused by this ridiculous hotel! We would have loved to have checked out and moved to another hotel, however, upon such short notice and only arranging three days in New York, time was very restricted. This hotel is PERFECT FOR BACKPACKERS WHO HAVE MONEY! The hotel is so small and running on a strictly cheap budget that there is no doorman in the morning upon check-out. It has been two days since we checked out and yes, we are still itching like crazy! This hotel does NOT guarantee to deliver.',\n",

This is truly a boutique hotel with it being a smaller property, but don't let that turn you off as the service is custom tailored. When getting out of the taxi, we had our bags taken care of right away and directed towards the check in counter. We had no problems at check in, and received a complimentary room upgrade which was a pleasant surprise. From that moment on after check in to our departure, all the staff were attentive, and knew our names, or took the time to introduce themselves.\\nOne of the most memorable was when in the elevator, and Brandon took the time to talk to my bf about his glasses, and how he had the same one.\\nAs previous posters have said, the rooms aren't super big, but this being NYC, this was expected, but the room was gorgeous. Leather closet doors that looked like trunks, an excellent bar area, and a comfortable big bed. The bathroom is amazing. While there was no bathtub, the shower made up for it as it was very large, and the toilet was quite neat with all these japanese style options. The amenities provided were also excellent.\\nWe also used the butler service to have our shoes shined, and clothes pressed before dinner.\\nHad a chance to use the pool, and gym facilities, which were adequate, but they were working with the space they had.\\nThe location was very close to Times Square, so that was convenient, but isolated so the noise and traffic would not affect your stay.\\nOur four night stay was quite pleasant, however you get what you pay for, and the Chatwal is pricey. Was it worth it? I would say yes because of the excellent service, and the upgrade. Thank you Chatwal for our excellent stay, and will definitely consider you again for our destination hotel in NYC.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"My wife and I stayed in four hotels in our recent trip across the US and this was our favourite. The location is great and was one of our key reasons for choosing Eventi. We arrived by train into New York Penn and it's only a short 5 min walk to the hotel. Being located on 6th Avenue at 30th Street means you're pretty central for the typical tourist area. The Empire State Building is just around the corner and Times Square is a 10 min stroll north.\\nThe hotel itself is very clean and modern in terms of the reception area and the rooms. I was amazed, everything looked brand new. The room was very spacious with a generously proportioned bathroom. The décor made the room feel very special and the bed was extremely comfortable.\\nThe staff were very helpful and check-in/out was a very swift process.\\nWe paid £148 per room per night which is fairly pricey, but I didn't feel like I'd been short changed. The hotel and location were worth it.\\nMy one issue with the hotel was the wi-fi access. Supposedly free, but we never managed to get it working. You have to fill in your details and wait for an email which gives you the necessary login details. Spot the big error here - how can I check my email if I don't have wi-fi?! 5 months later, the email still hasn't arrived...\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Took a Veterans Day weekend trip to The Chatwal for our anniversary. We used our Starwood points for the room. Little pricey, but it's a nifty hotel. The lobby area is small, but with gorgeous Art Deco. Interior of The Lambs Club restaurant is also really lovely. It's right off Times Square, so location is good for most things.\\nRooms at the Chatwal aren't super big, but this is NYC and this is a retro location, so I didn't expect massive space. What they lack in size, they make up for in appointments. The rooms are done up kind of like I'd imagine a 1920s cruise ship. Leather doors with leather handles, kind of like old time steamer trunks. Lots of cubbies and efficient use of space. Cool bar. Bathrooms are awesome. As others have mentioned, the toilets have an unreal number of functions--bidet, seat warmer, air dry. Too many functions, really, but fun when you're on vacation.\\nOur room was facing the alley, so nothing great on the view. But the room was nice enough that it didn't matter. Wish the bed had been a bit more comfy and higher off the floor--all the beds seemed very, very low--but overall I was pretty happy with the space. Service was great as well. Free shoe shine and you have a butler who can handle things like pressing your suit or dress for dinner.\\nDid have a bad situation, which highlights the excellence of the service. We'd been given a room with a connecting door. Unfortunately, next door were three single guys having a weekend in the city and the noise was unreal. Like they were standing right next to you talking in your ear while you were trying to sleep. So we got to participate when they got room service at 2 a.m. when they got up at 8:30 and then again when the maids came in to clean at 9. After the first night, we complained to the desk and they gave us a new room.\\nWe went out for the day and when we came back, they'd packed all of our things and moved them for us. And they were thorough--they even found the charger my husband had left plugged into the wall. So have to give them credit for the assist.\\nThat said, if you walk into your room and there's a connecting door and you're not with the people staying in the next room, immediately get a new one. You will hear everything.\\nOverall I enjoyed it. Honestly, I was probably expecting a little more for the level, so I wouldn't say it exceeded my expectations, but it was very nice. My gold status didn't really get us much of anything, so can't say Starwood helped much, other than to use the points. It's not inexpensive. It was 30,000 points plus per night, and more than $700 if we'd paid out of pocket. Not out of sync for this level in NYC, but the St. Regis was on the same point level and I can't say I think it's better than that. \\nBottom line--if you're looking for something retro and cool, it's great. If you need something more modern or a lot of space, probably not for you.\",\n",

They helped me get reservations at places that took months to get in on. I also made a reservation for my husband and i at the spa in the hotel. one of the BEST spas i have ever been to. being that my husband travels a lot. The staff at the spa Jason and Cynthia were welcoming relaxing made us feel like we made the right choice just off the welcome we got. They did not rush us to fill out out paper work or to the treatment, they made us a glass of wine just for it being our Anniversary a few weeks ago, to me that was amazing i would never expect such professionalism and kindness out of a spa before. After our treatments we paid and they again wished us a happy Anniversary and walked us down to the elevator pushed the button and contented to talk to us, going above and beyond to make us feel at home here at the hotel. i would stay at this hotel a million times and i will be recommending it to my friends and family.

Televisions are wall mounted flat screens, but set only about four feet off the ground, so unless you are in bed, an adult generally would look down to the screen. All in all, very strange and completely unnecessary. Finally, in the beautiful bath, black mold was evident in the tile grout and was also on the shower wall, although not obvious since it was obscured by the coloration of the tile.',\n",

Room was cleaned daily and you can ask for extra kitchen things, like sharp knife (!!) wine glasses etc. Supermarket is just over the road.\\nWe arrived on Thanksgiving and got excellent service from the check in manager and Kenny at the door was great. Other times it was not quite so good, or pleasant. And the information given out by the concierge regarding half tix booth downtown was incorrect. We ended up wasting half a day travelling downtown (which was closed due to Sandy) as a result.

The room was HUGE, very clean and we had a great view. Our room had a coffee machine, which was re-stocked with coffee pods and creamer every day by the cleaning staff. There is also a great restaurant next door, the owner was very nice and makes an effort to greet his customers (and remembers the ones who go back multiple times like us!). \\nMy only complaints:\\n1. (I don't know if this was an issue with our room only) - The bathroom didn't have any sort of ventilation, so we had to shower with the door open or the whole room would steam up. This wasn't a problem for us and wouldn't really be a problem for a couple, but could get awkward if you were staying with your boss on a business trip!\\n2. No complimentary wireless internet - For the amount of money we paid, it would have been nice to have access to wifi, even if we had to sit in the lobby or something to get it. They have the option of around $10 per day to get wireless in the room, or you could go to the computer room which only had 2 computers in it (and it was always full). \\nOverall - A great hotel. The staff were extremely friendly (especially the door men, who would happily stand and have a chat while we were waiting for a taxi), the room was lovely and it's in a great spot (walking distance to Times Square or easy access to the subway for those who don't want to walk). Would definitely recommend it to friends and family :)\",\n",

       "  'text': 'My husband and I stayed at the Sherry for two weeks and I wanted this “hotel” to be excellent as per the ratings on TA. We had just come from two weeks at The Greenwich Hotel in Tribeca which was fantastic.\\nThe ONLY reason this did not get a poorer rating is that the building is in a convenient location, this was a reason we choose not to move. You are right opposite Central Park with the horse and carriages and in short walking distance to all the main Fifth Avenue shops. Other positives were; spacious bedroom, heaps of wardrobe space, free wifi, free sodas that were refilled every day, comfy bed, plenty of bathroom amenities, choice of newspaper, heaps of TV channels and a coffee machine. Godiva chocolates were placed on our pillow at night, which you do not see often nowadays. There were a lot of old world touches.\\nRather than give you two weeks of examples of the poor service we received, I will list just a few, remembering we are paying $700+ per night, it was $635 and then you add all the taxes. Before I start with the negatives, the reason for my heading is that Sherry lacks a lot of services that a hotel has, for example, there is no lounge to go sit in, read and watch the world go by. There is no casual area to have a coffee or snack, just a small lobby with a couple of chairs so if you are staying here for any length of time, you are stuck in your room. There is no pool to go sit by. A previous reviewer stated that their stay was “odd” and now I understand why. For two weeks I was able to watch how the staff treat the hotel guests versus the residents of the building and it is very different, in fact, we felt like we were imposing and intruding, we did not feel like hotel guests. The concierge’s were polite but they had this underlying tone and attitude. \\nSo we arrive at the Sherry and are greeted by Alvin who collects our bags. We are checked in by the concierge and given a nice welcome until she looks at my passport photo and tells me how much I have aged. Now I just laughed it off, however upon reflection, this lady did not know me and is that appropriate behaviour from a five star hotel? Or maybe it is not a five star hotel, it is a residential building and she became too familiar with us?\\nAlvin takes us up to our room and we step out to renovations occurring on the second floor, which is where our room is. The concierge forgot to inform us of this when checking in. Alvin points out that the Business Centre is closed for renovation and lucky for us they have relocated it right next door to our room. Alvin shows us our room, we tip him and he stated that he is a native New Yorker and if we need anything he is around – we never saw Alvin again until check out two weeks later when he picked up our bags. There was a box of Godiva chocolates and flowers welcoming us. There were also two notes from the management. Both notes had different and incorrect spellings of my name. My booking was made by my travel agent so they had all the details – oh and my surname, only has four letters and my Christian name is also very easy. \\nI wondered about the renovations going on but at that time (it was about 3pm in the afternoon on a weekday) we could not hear any noise, so unpacked and settled in. We were happy. In fact, during the whole two week stay we did not actually hear much of the renovation going on, it is what woke us up each morning. As stated above, there was board on the floor in the hall way stuck together by masking tape. Each night it was removed and every morning (weekday) it was re-laid. So between 8.00 – 8.30am you would hear the ripping of masking tape and while doing this the person laying the board would have a very loud conversation with the housekeeping staff or other tradesmen, right near our room. So rather than wake up naturally, without fail we were woken by the staff of the “hotel”. There were mornings on the weekend when I woke up to the housekeeping staff calling out to bring more towels or for a staff member calling for security on her walkie talkie. My tip to the Sherry, if your guest has the “do not disturb” sign up and the paper is still outside their door it indicates they are still asleep.\\nThe bathroom – it was small. However, we had a bath, great I thought! Then I looked at the bottom of it, the non-slip surface was fifty shades of grey, there was no way I was sitting on that. It needed to be replaced or given a damn good bleach.\\nThis leads me into housekeeping, extremely inconsistent. If a hotel is renovating and it expects its guests to stay within the area during this phase then the housekeeping needs to be vigilant with keeping building dust to a minimum. After about four days I noticed the build up of dust. It is important to note here that there was a lot of drawers and wardrobe space so we did not leave a lot of personal items out on the side cabinets or tables. The housekeeping did not have to move any personal items to dust. By day five I was able to write words into the dust, I wrote “hello” on the TV stand and it still did not get cleaned. Day seven it did, only because I happened to be in the room at the time. I am not sure if the bathroom got cleaned, as there was a pubic hair on the daddo by the toilet and stayed there for the full two weeks with all the dust.\\nNow there are plenty more examples to provide but the piece de resistance was room service. We had been eating in a lot of restaurants and decided to stay in one night. I said to my husband all I feel like is a toasted cheese sandwich. He rings room service and orders one each. We get our order – two plates with covers. First thing we notice, only one glass of water, we laugh. Then we lift the lid and were shocked. The toasted sandwich was that, a cheese toasted sandwich. Not what you expect from a five star kitchen: there was no parsley for decoration, no fries, no salad just plain crappy white bread with plastic cheese and the crusts cut off and it was very dry (took a photo of it). Now you are probably saying, yeah, that is what you wanted. Yes but guess what we paid when I asked my husband what the amount was on the bill - $41.00 for two toasted sandwiches and one glass of water. I would not have minded if we got some fries and salad with that. In all my travels and I have been travelling most of my life that would go down as the worst hotel dish I have seen and the biggest RIP OFF! By the way, based on this dish we did not even want to waste our time and money going to the restaurant. \\nMy tip if you are staying at the Sherry, go around corner to the deli we got beautiful sushi (spicy crab) for $5.75. Also for the international visitors who may not know, you can take your washing to a dry cleaner and they do it for you, usually one pound of clothing costs about $1.00. We had 44 items of clothing washed and it cost $20.\\nBY the way I was happy to put all of this into a customer satisfaction feedback form but there was not one in our room. So with this experience in mind, go to a proper hotel, a place that provides the amenities a hotel of five star standard should. We certainly noticed the difference when we checked in at the Peninsula in Beverly Hills after staying at the Sherry – now there is a hotel! Oh and I checked what they charged for a toasted cheese sandwich - $12 but you got ham with that and tomato soup plus a bread basket and two glasses of water.\\nI will say that Fernando, the doorman was extremely polite and very helpful.',\n",

There is also good security at the hotel as in the evening there was always a security guard on the door.\\nThe hotel room was a decent size, very clean and the bed was very comfortable. However, we did find the lighting in our room a little dark. The air conditioning was good, especially as it was cold during our stay. It was also nice that we were able to open the windows for some fresh air if needed. The bathroom was well appointed. \\nIf you require a quiet room, I would recommend asking for a room at the back of the hotel. Even though you do not get the skyline view of the Empire State building, you will have a better night's sleep as 6th Avenue is always busy with traffic.\\nThe location of the hotel is great - close to the Empire State building, shops and the subway. Most things are within a short walk if you do not want to use public transport. There are also numerous bars and restaurants nearby - particularly in the Flatiron district.\\nIf you are a Kimpton In Touch member you receive free wifi for your stay and also a $15 gift card to use in the mini-bar.\\nThe wine hour is a nice bonus, however, we only went once. The hotel also offers complimentary tea and coffee in the lobby area in the morning - personally, we would have preferred a coffee machine/tea station in our room. \\nOverall a great stay at a great hotel.\",\n",

We were given an upgrade and had a spacious Junior Suite that was absolutely beautiful. The bathroom is amazing; 4 people could have fit in the shower. The suite should have had a bathtub, though, for the price paid. Location is fantastic - we were there for theatres, galleries, and shopping, and being near Times Square is fantastic. The rooms were very quiet and we slept very well. The staff is unfailingly polite and helpful. I would happily stay here again.',\n",

Pushbutton curtains, full kitchen/livingroom, beverage stocked fridge, washer/dryer!). Unlike others, I LOVE the minimalistic decor and found the staff (Gabriel, door/bell & concierge ladies) to be delightfully friendly, accommodating & attentive. I love the location (37th & 5th; Garment Dist same stores less crowded) because it's a nice retreat from hustle & bustle of Times Square/Midtown but still close to everything. Baffled at what others mean about the prices being higher; don't think it even compares. We will definitely be back (soon!). Glad we found this gem. (Did I mention the bed was beyond expectation too?

I value service,and the little touches that make a stay special, and this place is not in the league of the Ritz Carlton Central Park, the Mandarin Oriental, the Peninsula and others. I stayed here over Thanksgiving with my two daughters. It was a lovely one-bedroom apartment (as opposed to hotel suite). But there was no internet for half the stay. Half the time I called down to the front desk there was no answer. The gym was lacking. The staff was not up to a 5 star hotel. We had Thanksgiving dinner at the hotel, and that was a very good experience, even special. But the rest of the stay, mainly to do with the service, was disappointing, and thus I wouldn't pay the premium prices again. The rooms/apartments were first rate.\",\n",

I'd suggest to tip the bellman generously because it is the bellman who controls who uses the service. I remember him declining the service to a couple when you could clearly see the car parked a block down.

You are walking distance from many great restaurants and attractions, and a couple train stations (including Grand Central,) so you can get nearly anywhere by subway or train. Plus there are buses, and taxis (if you can afford to burn money and get hostile \"service.\")\\nAnyway, back to the Andaz 5th Avenue, everything was splendid from start to finish! The check-in was not just smooth...I was granted such a huge room upgrade that I was embarrassed. While accompanying me upstairs to see \"if I would approve of the room,\" I was basically drooling at the sheer enormity of the room, two large bedrooms, an ample living-dining area, a generous balcony, and the two baths were straight out of a palace.\\nI am very noise sensitive, and this is always a worry when I am in a hotel, and no matter how quiet it was in my room I never heard anything! (It helps to have had a large \"chunk\" of the building to myself.)\\nThe baths had exquisite amenities, the most heavenly showers I have enjoyed, the plushest towels I can recall, and there were luxurious robes every where. The bathrooms, and the closets had several.\\nThe high floor enabled me to leave the windows (which are also the walls) without the shades covering at night, so I could take in the spectacular views (NY Public Library, Empire State Building, etc.) every second. I did not listen to the stereo nor watch TV/DVDs, but the room was equipped to be entertained in style.\\nThe minibar...ahhhh, finally a minibar the way it would be if I chose what goes in it! Juices, water, delicious teas, and nutritious snacks! I think there may have been a beer or two, but I did not notice.\\nOn to a perfect night\\'s sleep. King orthopedic bed, fine linens, and not a sound! Plus, the view of NYC from my bed!\\nBreakfast? Yum! As a diamond member I got a huge made-to-order breakfast that was about as good as I have ever had. No charge!\\nOh, and I called for breakfast \"before hours\" to have it delivered when \"breakfast began,\" and there was a gentle knock on my door at the appointed time. To the second. I think the person bringing the food arrived a couple minutes early and waited for the precise second to knock. And that is the kind of service the Andaz 5th Avenue gives!\\nI was sorry to have been solo, as this was a room and experience to share!\\nCheckout went without a hitch (4 PM, as per diamond benefits), and I was sure sorry to leave!',\n",

       "  'text': 'This hotel is considered a Marriott property, but is part of their Autograph Collection which is a group of \"independent\" hotels. A former bank building, this hotel did a great job with renovations. The rooms are spacious and have lots of character. The front desk staff is very friendly. And, the bar/restaurant in the lobby has a great atmosphere and a pretty decent menu. We enjoyed the buffet breakfast on Sunday - $10.95 for a buffet that included your beverage. Not a bad deal!\\nThe elevators are original to the building and are a bit on the small side, but that is to be expected. You do have to use your key to get to any of the guest room floors, and this became a bit of an ordeal a couple of times. My key wasn\\'t working in the elevator and I ended up seeing five different floors before I could make it back down to the lobby to get a new room key.\\nA neat feature of this hotel is that it offers a free shuttle within a five mile radius. We definitely got our use out of this! However, just beware that there is not much to do/see within a three mile radius. In fact, Downtown Houston seemed pretty desolate on the weekends. Across the street from the hotel is the Preston Station for the Houston light rail metro. At only $1.25 a fare, it\\'s a good way to get to a few different parts of the city.\\nThere are a handful of restaurants around the hotel. One suggested to us by staff was Macondo on Congress - great, diverse menu and an awesome place for breakfast!\\nIf I would ever return to Houston, I would definitely stay here. However, I hope I never have to visit Houston again. But, that\\'s a different review...',\n",

Apparently on the pent house floor there are also hospitality suites directly across the hall from the guest suites. By design this is a very poor choice by the hotel as hospitality suites are typically for parties. Yes, we were staying across the hall from a loud drunken open house party! The music was loud, the people were in and out of the suite causing a big disturbance in our suite. A note was slipped under our door by the Party Hostess suggesting that she knew it was loud and that we should join them. This is not at all what we had in mind for our wedding night. At 12:30am when we couldn't take anymore we checked out and found another hotel. The attendant at the front desk was considerate and understanding as we conveyed the issues and didn't charge us for the room. I can only think that the rental price for the Hospitality Suite was much more than our guest suite as no additional solutions to the problem were offered. The whole experience was frustrating. Absent that,the hotel appeared to be clean and nice.\",\n",

It was a one bedroom suite with 2 Queen beds + 1 sofa bed. Perfect for a family of 4 with 2 children who didn't want to sleep in the same bed!\\nWe were told that there is no view as it is a small hotel (18 floors) but it was a view for us (see photo below)! \\nThe hotel receives a lot of Spanish speaking hosts and it is nice and cosy family hotel. Each and every of the employees we met during our stay were nice and helpful. A man at the reception even did a magic trick to our son who laughed in delight. Complimentary umbrellas were offered to use when it started to rain which was much appreciated.\\nWe found restaurants all around and the area is nice and relatively calm which was good as we were able to choose different food depending on our mood.\\nA hotel we will definitely go back to.

       "  'text': 'I love to visit NYC and usually do so on girlfriend trips. I have researched numerous hotels, looking for those that have the ability to accommodate our needs. San Carlos is one of the very, very few that offers two queen beds in a nice large room. The San Carlos is located across from the Waldorf, and is wonderfully situated for access to public transportation, walking to your favorite big box stores, restaurants, etc., etc. The rooms are very clean, the beds and bedding are very comfortable, free wi-fi, a desk, mini fridge and bar, and lounge chair. The continental breakfast is convenient, not a gourmet set up, mind you, but perfectly suitable for a quick bite to begin your day in the city! I\\'ve stayed in rooms that face the back, which has a view of the next building. I\\'ve had lovely quiet stays both times. I\\'m only there to sleep. I actually get a kick out of watching the office building come to life from dark stillness to bright activity, like a scene from a TV show. The front desk is always the best part of my stay, did you know there are two gentlemen there that have quite the set of pipes? Ask to find out who sings Louie Armstrong\"s \"It\\'s a Wonderful World\", and who sounds like Bing Crosby!',\n",

       "  'text': 'When flooding from hurricane Sandy forced me to evacuate my lower Manhattan apartment, I had a latenight, last minute search for a hotel in Manhattan (difficult) that would also allow me to bring my two 60lb dogs (virtually impossible), and not spend $700+ per night to do so. After much searching with AmEx emergency services (Great job from them as well), The Eventi showed up as the only practical option.\\nI travel frequently and I often stay at Kimpton properties because I like their unique designs. I am low-maintenance when I\\'m on the road and it is rare that the performance of the staff has any significant impact on my stay. After a harrowing five days of urban camping in my powerless and waterless apartment, the Eventi staff took us all in like family, and made the world seem safe and normal again.\\nPatrick, Gabriella , and I wish I could remember everyone\\'s names, but suffice it to say that the entire desk and valet staff were phenomenal. Robert, the GM, has pulled together a special group of people. They greeted us warmly and played with our dogs. The next morning, staff that we hadn\\'t even met knew the names of the animals and would greet them by name when I took them out for walks. They offered treats. They even remebered that one dog likes her head scratched and the other one likes his butt scratched. They helped us with dry cleaning and laundry. The housekeeping staff were excellent and had the room spotlessly clean every day - even the fur was gone. When I had to bring a cat from my apartment because she was ill, a filled litter pan and a small bag of cat food was waiting outside the room door when I returned (I never even thought to ask for one). Our menagerie ended up staying for eight days until we confirmed that we would not be able to return to our apartment for several months, and we relocated out of State to stay with family. One night, I was bringing back pizza to eat in the room (from Waldie\\'s - an excellent pie). The doorman saw the box and said \"Aha! You discovered Waldie\\'s. Their pizza is fantastic\". A few minutes later, we were all sharing the pizza in the lobby and laughing and telling stories around the front desk like we had all been friends since college.\\nAs for the room: Beautiful. Quite subdued by Kimpton standards, with lots of dark wood and chocolate tones. Very contemporary and elegant. Terrific bed, sheets and pillows. And the bathroom has a killer huge shower with multiple shower heads. \\nOf particular note to those who travel with their animals: You know how most hotels have \"pet friendly\" rooms that the hundreds of pets have gotten waaaay too friendly with? Yeah, THAT smell. The room at the Eventi showed absolutely no evidence of odor or dirt or scratches on the doors. it was a perfectly beautiful room that became our home for a week.\\nObviously, hurricane Sandy will be an unforgettable event in my life. However, neither will the professionalism and true kindness shown by the Eventi staff be forgotten. We all thank you so much!!!',\n",

       "  'text': 'Just recently had a single night stay at the Eventi. The hotel and room were meticulously clean and well maintained, which is always my first priority. Location is great, close to subway stops and walking distance to Penn station. Location is of course subjective in NYC, depending on where you need to be.\\nWe stayed in a city-view king on the 18th floor. Spectacular views, our room faced east so we had an excellent view of the Empire State Building. Road noise was reasonable during the day and practically non-existent at night with the blinds drawn. HVAC noise was of course present but within a reasonable level. Room was perfectly clean, great condition, and quite sizable by city standards. Bathroom was spacious, modern and functional. My only complaint with the entire property was with the bed. I prefer a really firm mattress and this one was a bit soft for my liking. Actually seemed like the topper could use replacing. That being said we slept fine, pillows and linens were nice.\\nWe ate breakfast and dinner in the restaurant and the food was very good. Culinary choices are plentiful in NYC but it’s nice to know that you can also get quality food without leaving the hotel. There’s also a free wine hour in the late afternoon which my wife took advantage of, she commented that it was a great opportunity to meet other travelers.\\nThe staff were friendly and attentive. We arrived at around 11AM expecting to just drop off our luggage but they had a room available so we were able to check in immediately. The day we checked out it was raining so I asked the staff were I could get an umbrella. They said we could use the one from the room, even though we were checking out, and to just return it before we left the city. These are just little things that make the stay more enjoyable.\\nGreat hotel, great stay, would highly recommend.',\n",

The room was beautifully decorated and very interesting - I wish I had a toilet like that in my home - but a few things didn't work and I can't help but think that having a lot of technology means more to maintain.

       "  'text': 'I had booked my stay at the Setai as a 25th wedding anniversary/50th birthday treat for my husband and myself. Setting this trip in context, we are the parents of a profoundly learning disabled son and we had to negotiate and save our respite care for a year so that we could have our first holiday alone since our honeymoon. This was to be the most luxurious,spoilt treat of our lifetime.\\nIn April, we booked the Suite Surrender package staying in an Empire State Suite. The package at that time was similar to the one currently on offer which promised:\\n• The attention of a Personal Assistant, a signature service provided by Capella Hotels and Resorts\\n• A couture kitchen filled with New York City’s finest flavors, stocked once and entirely prior to your arrival\\n• Complimentary refreshment center \\n• A bottle of Taittinger Rosé champagne and fresh fruit upon arrival\\n• a $100 Auriga credit per night for treatments in-suite or in the luxurious Auriga spa. \\n• Complimentary pressing of up to 5 items and shoe shine on the date of your arrival\\nUnlike the current offer, we were not promised the Bergdorf Goodman voucher but instead a luxury breakfast delivered daily to our suite. \\nI specified that I wanted a room on as high a floor as possible and emphasised that this was a special occasion.\\nWe were waiting for the call from our personal assistant prior to our arrival, but the call didn\\'t come.\\nOn arrival at the hotel, the door men did not open the door as we struggled through with our luggage and with only one member of staff on duty at reception joined the line to check in. Things started to look up when we were told we had been upgraded as this was a special occasion and we were allocated room 2702. Bizarrely,we were walked to the elevator and whilst in the elevator the promise of pressed clothes was explained -surely this should have been done at the reception desk? \\nStill, we headed to our room, excited about our upgrade. This was an eagerly anticipated stay, so I had devoured the website and all of the photos, so when I entered the City one bedroom suite I was disappointed. This was NOT and upgrade but a DOWN grade. Although this suite was bigger in square footage, it was a cheaper suite. We looked for the bottle of champagne and fruit but there was none. We looked in the fridge for the finest flavours of NYC and found 6 small bottles of soda a bottle of water and four milk creamers for coffee.\\nI was gutted.\\ni phoned down to reception but no-one answered. I phoned the personal assistant line only to told it was nothing to do with them and I needed to contact reception. I explained I could not get through and asked if the city room was a lower grade room than an empire room, I was told by the personal assistant that it was a downgrade and she put me on hold and eventually through to reception. No apology was forthcoming for the poor service in fact I felt reprimanded for challenging the upgrade and was told that the suites had been renamed since I booked and that I indeed had an upgrade. Strange though that the same names are advertised currently on the website and that indeed, the empire suite is about $300 a night more expensive that our city room.\\nThe receptionist said she would send up the missing elements of our package when it was checked out. We were by now exhausted, having been travelling for over 21 hours. We had just wanted to crack open the champagne, drink to our anniversary and get some rest. We waited over an hour for the delivery and then decided to get some sleep as the goods were clearly not coming. Half an hour into our sleep the door was persistently knocked. My husband had to get up, dress and answer the door to receive:\\n the bottle of champagne\\n the fresh fruit - this was in fact a small plate of sliced fruit salad.\\n a wine glass with more fresh fruit salad and plain yoghurt\\n a dish of nuts\\n three one oz pieces of cheese on a tray\\n a four pack of beer\\n a four pack of root beer.\\n~Sorry, but do these latter 4 items classify as New York\\'s finest flavors? In a five star hotel, I was expecting a lot more. AND they did NOT stock the fridge, they barely filled one shelf.\\nOn rising on Sunday 28th October, we headed to Ai Fiori with our complimentary breakfast vouchers. Again, we had been promised luxury breakfasts in our room, instead we were given 6 continental breakfast vouchers for a muffin, croissant and danish with orange juice and a coffeee. Hardly luxury. Even this was poorly served. We submitted our vouchers and then were billed $60. We finished our coffees and had to ask for a refill. My husband called over the waiter, he went for the coffee pot, then filled my husband\\'s cup and walked away leaving my cup empty. Surely, a Michelin starred restaurant has heard of silver service?\\nWe headed out into Manhattan. We would have loved at this point to have had our personal assistant organise a ride in the Maserati as we were heading to Tiffanys to get a ring to celebrate our occasion, but as for the entire duration of our stay, we were not allocated a personal assistant \"the signature service provided,\" therefore we did not get that opportunity.\\nOn no occasion, did any member of staff apology for the lack of service or the failure to provide what was being paid for. All of these issues are basic customer care issues, a product was ordered and it was down to the staff of the Setai to deliver, but this was a total failure.\\nSubsequent issues resulted from the skeleton staff in situ.\\nWhen we arrived back in the hotel after our few hours in Manhattan, we picked up the letter stating that due to the imminent arrival of Hurricane Sandy, we would not have a housekeeping service. So we did not have any of the snacks delivered each afternoon that previous guests have raved about. We did not have any amenities replaced - i.e. soaps, and when we ran out of Nespresso capsules it took 3 requests and 9 hours before we had them delivered. We appreciate that staff were under pressure by this time, but we offered to collect the capsules from reception on two occasions and on each we were told they would be sent up to our room, without any apology. Ironically, they arrived 30 minutes before the power outage.\\nOn Monday, we had no restaurant service and had to eat in the bar. In the evening, we were provided with a buffet dinner at a cost of $25 per person. Two choices of main course, one potato, one veg. Considering the conditions,$25 was taking advantage.\\nBy Monday night, the power was out and so we were in darkness, no elevators (Essential on the 27th floor), no hot water in the morning and bread, cheese and ham for breakfast. \\nIn summation, during our luxury break we had:\\n A downgraded room - one bedroom suite instead of Empire state - which had been specifically requested\\n No personal assistant service\\n One turndown service\\n No daily clean of suite for entire stay\\n None of the promised surrender package (until minimum arrived after complaint)\\n No breakfast in suite\\n Use of the Nespresso machine for one out of three days (due to lack of capsules)\\n One breakfast in Ai Fiori\\n Power and hot water for two out of three nights.\\nYet, we were billed the full amount for our stay of over $3400. We did mention the lack of the suite surrender package, specifically mentioning the lack of the spa vouchers and were cheekily told that we could have the vouchers. What use would they have been with the spa closed and the power out?\\nWe were offered a 50% reduction on the cost of our final night - the one with no power, water or food, which we did take BUT we were greatly under stress by this point. We had just been told our flight was cancelled, our son was due home with noone to care for him and we had to find a hotel in a city where 9000 flights had been cancelled stranding many others in a similar situation. With hindsight, we were sold short. We should been paying the cost of a one bedroom suite -without the package, we should have had the $100 per night spa voucher returned along with $120 the apparent cost of the four breakfasts we did not get. Without basic housekeeping we should have received some compensation. Our lifetime holiday- an opportunity we will NEVER have again, was in ruins. Not due to Sandy, but due to uncaring, inhospitable staff. \\nWe are very understanding of the difficult situation that staff were put in when NYC went into close down, but it needs to be stated that in our \"new\" hotel, the Westin Grand Central, we were made to feel very welcome, we were given free coffee when we arrived to check if they had room, they gave us free wifi for our entire stay to allow us to get in contact with home to make arrangements for our son and they had such a friendly outlook that staff in the Setai could learn from. \\nThis was sent to the Setai management and a phonecall to discuss this has been promised, but as yet has not happened. It appears from subsequent reviews that our experience was not unique yet others seem to have a magical time. Customer service should be consistently of a high standard at any price.',\n",

       "  'text': \"My partner and I went on holiday to NYC on 27/10/12 (the day before Hurricane Sandy!!!!) and booked to stay at the Hotel Beacon. After reading previous reviews on here it was recommended that we emailed in advance to request a high corner room away from the lifts. I did choose to email in advance as I also wanted to inform the hotel that I was planning to propose to my girlfriend. I received a swift response from the reservations department and they were very polite. \\nUpon arrival, our room wasn't ready (we were two hours early) but the staff were very friendly and informative. They recommend a few local shops and food places if we wanted to pass the time. When we arrived back after just over an hour the room was ready and we were allocated a room on the 21st floor (there is only 25 floors in the hotel). I do not cope well with confined spaces etc but the speed of the lifts was excellent and I managed to survive the constant use! :). We arrived at our room and it appeared we had been given a larger room (possibly because I emailed in advance) and we also received a complimentary bottle of wine and box of chocolates which was a lovely touch. The room was excellent, large, spacious, very clean with more than enough storage. The views from our huge window were fantastic! The concierge were attentive and informative without being pushy (this was my partners 6th time in NYC and they did not feel the need to tell her anything as she had good local knowledge). \\nEven though NYC pretty much shut down for a few days, the housekeeping service was still available (albeit on a reduced staff) and they were very polite. If you are there for a few nights (we were for 5) I would recommend that on your first morning to leave a $10 dollar tip and a note to housekeeping then leave $2/$3 for the duration of your stay and you will end up with plenty of extra toiletries/towels/pillows etc or anything else you may need. \\nThe hotel staff kept all guests up to date with information regarding local facilities that were still available during the hurricane. \\nWe were both very impressed with Hotel Beacon and the staff and will certainly be planning on staying there again when we visit again next year. It is extremely popular with a wide variety of ages and people visiting for various reasons. I highly recommend the Hotel Beacon.\\nP.S. my partner agreed to marry me when I proposed! I also received an email from the hotel to congratulate us.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Stayed 2 nights recently during a conference. The hotel is a typical Hilton - which is to say very nice. The executive lounge has a decent selection of items during breakfast and cocktail hour. The rooms are large with the usual Hilton amenities. There is no mini-fridge, but you can request one when you check in. \\nSince the hotel is part of the convention center and across the street from the Toyota Center, it is a great location if you are participating in something at one of those places. Otherwise, this part of Houston leaves alot to be desired.\\nRoom service was the one disappointment. It was half cold and sub par. I had breakfast in the hotel restaurant one morning. It had the usual Hilton Buffet option which I always enjoy. The buffet is a quality buffet with cook to order items and a selection of hot and cold items. It is a bit pricey, but worth it. Please note that the \"spencer\\'s steakhouse\" restaurant has closed. It will be replaced by a mexican place of some sort although it didn\\'t appear that would be the case anytime soon.\\nThere is a UPS store onsight, or you can go across the street to the convention center and visit the fedex office.\\nThere is some construction going on in this area of downtown, so be aware that some sidewalks are blocked off. \\nThere is self-parking for $19 a day or valet for about twice that. Self -park ...it is in a garage that is connected by a walkway. \\nThe hotel offers wifi for a fee. One of the advantages of booking on the executive level is free internet. My job requires it, so between the free wifi and the snacks/continental breakfast in the EL, the slight increase in the room rate is worth it to me.\\nEvery single staff person I encountered was very friendly and helpful. I always appreciate that. I travel quite a bit and it is nice to stay somewhere that appreciates you as a customer and truly wants to meet any special requests you need.',\n",

Again as I passed reception, I sometimes felt like I was breaking into a conversation - this sort of behaviour needs work.\\nOverall - I like this place and book it whenever I am in Houston but its not as great as many seem to make out - book with caution understanding this is an ok hotel so just don't expect it to be amazing or you may be disappointed. Guess my rating is 3.5 but think it falls short of very good for reasons given.\\nManagement - please try to comment in plain and clear English, I have read many of the responses and often have no idea what you're trying to say - still not sure if your last response to me was some kind of put-down or if you really intended doing something different based on my feedback, thanks for a nice stay again this time.\\nRob\",\n",

I was there for six weeks from mid-March through early May and the entire staff did their best to provide the comforts of home for me. The general manager Ken, chef Damon, bartender Jason, the front desk guys and gals - all of them were great and went out of their way to make my stay as pleasant as possible. I was most impressed the day that I had to go to the urgent care clinic, left my phone there, and a front desk gal hopped into the Hilton van and retrieved it for me; I was so grateful. Any time that there was an issue - and there are always minor issues at any hotel, especially during a stay that lone - they fixed it pronto - and that's really what counts. It's not about perfection, it's about dedication and commitment to guest comfort and wellbeing, and the Hilton Garden Inn on Katy Freeway is the place to stay for that in Houston.\",\n",

The Four Seasons is one of the more comfortable places I've stayed in and especially well set up for our group (pushing 90 people at each board meeting). I'd be pressed to call Houston a beautiful city with a charming ambiance, nor is the hotel itself an interesting structure, but the guest rooms are well decorated, nicely sized and have excellent bedding, especially in the case of the small suites to which I'm occasionally upgraded. The meeting rooms are quite well designed, and, best of all, everything works - including AV and conference lines, which in most places are disasters waiting to happen. Perhaps the nicest surprise is a small private dining room hidden behind the wine rack in the restaurant, which can only be accessed by walking through the kitchen. Since the food and food service are both good, it makes a quirkily cozy addition to a meal.\",\n",

Hotel Entrance feels awkfard as it's through a smallish side door with no guard/valet, then through another door comes the hotel reception/lounge/bar/restaurant. very nice modern hotel lobby, dark wood (seems to be a big theme in houston). Mostly friendly staff. one guy when asked for recommendation couldn't seem to care less but everyone else we spoke to was nice. i really like the deluxe room with kingsize bed and jacuzzi. The room did feel like it hadn't been aired so would have loved to open the window but for security reasons that was not possible. Tried putting AC on high for a while to change the air but it didn't do much of a difference. Other than that small inconvenience, bed clean, very comfortable and couldn't ask for anything else.

With that said, request to be put in a room away from the very loud construction happening directly adjacent to the building. It starts promptly at 7am even on weekends. \\nThe staff at Sorella, while pleasant, seem ill-trained for the \"high end boutique\" that Sorella is marketed as. Simple questions to guest services seemed to trip up and confuse them, i.e. \"Is there a nail salon near by\" (the on site \"spa\" only provides massages...no other services), \"Where is the room service the we ordered an hour and a half ago?\" (It was a grilled cheese, BTW), \"Can I get an early check in?\", etc...\\nWe really didn\\'t have a bad experience, but this hotel does have some ends to tie up before we would return.

The location was perfect, it is in the middle of the U of H campus, but had easy parking in the parking garage. Our check-in was very quick and we were given a clean, modern, and lovely room. After checking in, we were tired and hungry, so we found the restaurant downstairs which was still open. Our food was very good, so good that we decided to go back the next morning for the breakfast buffet. The buffet was exceptional as well, with a large variety of options. My husband needed help with tying his tie and the wonderful staff at the front desk were happy to help. :-) All in all, would recommend this hotel for not only those associated with the UH campus, but for any travelers who want a nice place to stay for a reasonable amount of money.\",\n",

       "  'title': '“Pleasant enough, but a bit overrated”',\n",
       "  'text': 'For our most recent ever-so-brief New York visit (2 days, 1 night), we decided to try the Setai, based on TA reviews and a decent flash sale private website offer. The hotel was pleasant enough, but a bit overrated in my opinion, mostly due to inconsistent service. My brother also happened to be staying at the hotel, using the same flash sale but for a longer stay, so we were able to compare our experiences. His room was actually directly above ours.\\nFirst off, I would have to say this is not my favourite New York neighbourhood--5th Ave. between 36th and 37th. While such tourist sites as the Empire State Building, Macy\\'s and Lord and Taylor are nearby, I prefer the sites and shops on or near 5th Ave. 15-25 blocks north-- Saks, Barneys, the Top of the Rock, MOMA. Bryant Park, the NY Public Library and the Morgan Library are also nearby. When we walked from the hotel toward Times Square to catch a play (\"The Heiress\"), we walked down a street (37th?) that had store after store of cheesy discount evening gowns.\\nThe hotel itself is lovely, occupying the lower floors of a 57 story building designed by Gwathmey Siegel, who did the Guggenheim Museum\\'s addition. This was one of Charles Gwathmey\\'s last projects before his untimely passing. Perhaps most unique are the hotel\\'s angular windows that open to let in a decent amount of fresh air. The lobby is more like a foyer, not really a space to sit and relax, but has some nice design touches, especially the curved stairway leading to the 2nd floor restaurant (A Fiori) and the pendulous teardrop-like sculpture in its centre. The Bar on Fifth, where one can sit and relax, is just beyond the lobby. The hotel has a flexible check-in/check-out policy, so when we arrived rather early after our red-eye flight, our room was ready. A very kind and friendly bellman escorted us to the room and remembered and acknowledged us whenever we passed by later on.\\nOur room was a Standard Room, the lowliest of room categories. It was actually quite spacious by New York standards (420 sq. feet), with almost half the space occupied by the sumptuously appointed bathroom, leaving the bedroom area a bit cramped. The next room category up, the Superior room, has the same square footage but a larger bedroom and smaller bath. The room was sleekly designed in shades of brown and beige, with wood paneling. The view was a \"courtyard\" view of the backsides of buildings that faced 36th or 37th St.--there was actually a good amount of natural light, and the bathroom also had a window, All windows were floor to ceiling. The bath had a dual head shower (rain or hand-held) over the tub. \\nWhat I liked:\\nThe complimentary Nespresso machine and refreshment centre (minifridge with sodas and water--no minibar). The high definition TV. The aforementioned angular windows. The nicely designed door jam that is a refreshingly modern alternative to the standard chain and bolt. The bath toiletries. The large WC alcove.\\nWhat was less impressive:\\nThe highly touted Duxiana bed was low-slung--a box spring topped by what looked like a mattress topper but no mattress (A peek at the Duxiana website shows that this is in fact one of their bed\\'s designs--the \"magic\" apparently is in the number of springs in the base. Yes, it was comfortable, but not out of this world). Only 2 king pillows--4 would have been nice. Only one hand towel and one face cloth, but 2 bath towels and 2 bath sheets. The WC alcove could have used a door. Our shower curtain was full-length, but the one in my brother\\'s room was at least a foot short of the tub ledge, leaving a frightfully dangerous, slippery wet marble surface after showering--a lawsuit waiting to happen. The TV is not wall-mounted, but rather sits on top of the desk, usurping valuable space. There is free Wifi, but no one told me you needed a password. The closet in the Standard rooms are not full length. The bedside cordless phones are hard to operate. The desk phone has a large lighted screen than cannot be dimmed while sleeping. We did not receive morning newspaper delivery, nor did my brother on any day. My brother got cookies with turndown, we got water from the refreshment centre. After we had checked-in (early), we spent an hour or so in the room, during which time the housekeeping staff and others could clearly be heard going about their business. At least 3 people tried to enter the room, only one knocked (luckily we had the door jam engaged). We heard a lot of doors opening and closing--it turned out the room across the way from ours was being used as a housekeeping storage room. A stairway door was also nearby.\\nOur package included breakfast (a set value to be used in the restaurant or in-room), which we took in the restaurant--quite nice. Interestingly, for some selections, one is not served potatoes, but always a small salad. We also had late night room service (club sandwiches)-- also quite nice, and again with salads instead of carbs. There is a spa and salon that occupies the 4th floor, but we did not try these services. The fitness centre is on the 3rd floor (although the elevators say its on the 4th), as is the business centre--2 small key-accessed rooms housing computers and printers.\\nIf this hotel was situated in an area more suited to my likings, it would definitely be on the list of possible accommodations. Even now, I would consider a return visit, but the luxury hotel milieu in Manhattan is highly competitive and somewhat large, so the Setai must pay attention to every detail to stay in the game.',\n",

       "  'text': 'We stayed at the Hilton in 2006 on a conference. We visited Houston to visit our daugher and her husband as they have recently settled here. We were lucky to go over Thanksgiving and take advantage of great rates - Hilton luxury for less than $150 per night all in. My daughter lives in Midtown and the hotel was less than 10 minutes away so quite convenient for our stay.\\nWe selected the Hilton as we had good memories from our previous visit. The other Houston hotels had viarable Tripadvisor reviews and were expensive. We stayed with what we knew and have not been dissappointed.\\nThe executive floor was under renovation but this did not detract from our stay. We had a very comfortable room - twin queen beds, large work area, big bathroom, all the needed facilities - tea, coffee, iron, toiletries and safe. Ceramic cups would be better than the paper ones for the room though.\\nThe staff made our stay this time round. The valet was great - parking to allow us to get situated etc.., Guest Services exceptional - quick, efficient and polite. Requests for fridge, bathrobe, unblocking toilet, toilet paper, towels and linen were all effectively handled and we did not feel like we were \"bothering\" them - to the contrary - \"we are happy to help to make sure your stay is memorable\". And this over Thanksgiving! We were also given free wifi as our Thankgiving gift. The first receptionist we dealt with was a bit iffie. Her supervisor corrected her deficiencies.\\nParking at $30 per night is very expensive. We were transported by my daughter and did not need a car. However, casual parking for her was expensive at $8 per 2 hours. The hotel does offer a good shuttle service to downtown (Macy\\'s etc) and will fetch you. This was really appreciated. \\nWe will be back to see my daughter and husband and will stay here again if possible.',\n",

Second night ordered room service, silverware was missing, the chicken for the chicken salad was missing and my order was incorrect. Called, they brought us silverware, chicken for the salad but didn\\'t correct my order. Later that evening I dropped something by the nightstand and found a open condom wrapper. That was kind of the boiling point and we finally went to talk to the manager the next morning. He/she was not in so we talked to the front desk person. When we told her about the condom wrapper she said \"eeeeggghhhhhh\" and said that \"she has no idea what is up with the cleaning staff lately\" told us that she would tell the manager. We never heard anything from the manager, asked the front desk about it when we checked out, no one knew anything about it????? We are not whiners or complainers as we worked and still work in the hospitality business and have seen it all. When we got home we filled out a survey from the hotel and explained our issues....and still nothing. I can\\'t believe what happened, how it was handled and how we were never contacted about our issues. We will never stay there again and will make sure to share our experiences with our clients and friends.',\n",

The quality of materials in the room exceeds your typical Marriott room. Large LG flat screen TV, good carpets, good drapes, fixtures, etc. all of nice quality. Great 4 cup coffee maker.\\nBathroom: Good size, nice granite counters, huge Jacuzzi tub, huge shower with the best water pressure I have ever experienced. Tub and shower were clean, but Jacuzzi was very hard to activate; a maintenance man showed us how to turn it on by repeatedly using shallow pushes to the start button. Also, several jets came off while using the tub. It’s a nice feature but was not maintained. \\nBed: Very good bed. \\nHouskeeping: Average. We left a tip requested extra bath towels. Housekeeping took the tip but did not leave towels. \\nRestaurants: We cannot recommend the hotel restaurant. We had the full breakfast buffet on Thanksgiving morning. Both the food and staff were sub-par. The buffet was not restocked, and we had to scavenge the dregs of what remained. Several core items were out of stock on the buffet including jam and fruit. The bacon was swimming in grease. We finally asked the staff to bring us fruit, and they did. However, the staff’s attitude was lackadaisical at best. We even had to get up to get our own water after waiting an extended period of time. This was probably our worst dining experience at any Marriott owned hotel. \\nBar: The bar in the lobby looked very nice, but we did not patronize it. \\nGrounds: This is a downtown hotel. So there are no real “grounds.” Great gym in the basement. \\nPool: we didn’t see one\\nStaff attitude/service: The front desk was good, but the restaurant staff was bad. \\nPerks for status: Platinum gift/points offered at check-in. Upgraded room also provided. \\nParking: Valet only. The valets were very efficient and helpful. \\nMisc: This is a quaint, historic hotel. We loved the lobby. And the valets were very knowledgeable about downtown and restaurants. Use caution at night downtown. There are many bums in this part of downtown. I worked nearby at Pennzoil Place (about 5 blocks away) in the late 90s, and never noticed bums during the day. But they are everywhere at night, even urinating in public. Although the Houston Police Department is also downtown, we saw no police patrolling this part of downtown at night. \\nPhotos are of room 1108.',\n",

The area seemed to be friendly to families, couples, and singles. \\nThe only downside was finding the hotel and parking availability. There was a lot of construction going on when I stayed at Hotel Sorella, and my boyfriend and I found it difficult at first to find the hotel/entrance of the hotel. Also, there was limited parking, if you don't want to use valet. Again, because of construction, a big section of the parking garage was blocked off.

A full cable 42\" flat screen TV was mounted on the wall above dresser drawers and in room coffee by the cup was located above another similar stack of drawers. A refrigerator was available for our room and the restaurant was pleased to take take care of our need for a microwave. An iron and ironing board were in the full length armoire, an illuminated magnifying make up mirror and and hair dryer were in the bath with a frosted glass pocket door.\\nIce and vending were in a separate room with a door keeping noises out of the hallway. Room service was available and housekeeping responded promptly with extra coffee packets upon our request. Our group shared complimentary remarks of their experiences.',\n",

This is right on campus and very nice - the junior suite rooms are very modern and a step above for a Hilton. Staff was young but very nice. There is no fitness center at the hotel - you are given a pass to the university wellness center. It is a great facility but one that does not open until 6 AM. Being on east coast time with an office that opens at 8 AM and a longer distance runner, would have liked to worked out a bit earlier to log a few more miles but it seemed to be a fair trade in this case.

       "  'text': \"Hotel Icon is a very nice boutique hotel in downtown Houston. The building is beautiful, I believe it was a bank at one time, and you can still see the old vault behind the reception area. There are various room configurations, so make sure you know what you are getting when you book. They have accessible rooms, which is great if you require this access, but not so great if you don’t need it. There is no pool at this hotel, and they have no agreements with any local hotels for access to their pool. It would have been nice for a cool down after a hot day, but not a deal breaker, if you're there on business.\\nI found my room to be clean and the furnishings in excellent condition. I had a corner room, so I had lots of windows and light. The ceilings are nice and high, which adds to the feeling of space. There is a large desk, and Wi-Fi is free, so it’s great for business travelers. I had a very comfortable King bed in my room and the pillows were OK, but they did get a bit flat after a few hours, so I had to use two. \\nThe TV reception was sketchy – most of the lower channels were all snow, and there were not too many to choose from.\\nThe bathroom was huge! My bathroom had a large walk-in shower, but no tub. The water pressure was good, and I never ran out of hot water. There was a standard shower head and a rain shower fixture. A colleague was also staying at this hotel, and she had a tub in her bathroom, so it sounds like there are multiple bathroom configurations, too. Shampoo, conditioner and body wash are in a dispenser, and a bar of soap is included for the sink area. Good sized vanity, with lots of space for toiletries, and a lighted makeup mirror. You can get a hair dryer on request.\\nI was here for a conference, and I found the hotel staff friendly and helpful, the room clean and well suited for my needs, and the location convenient for everything I needed to do. \\nThere is a restaurant at the hotel - The Line & Lariat. It is a really nice restaurant, and the food is very good. Breakfast is great and the service at breakfast was exemplary. Lunch service is at the bar, and was also excellent. I had the crab cakes for lunch and they were really good.\\nDiner service, however, leaves a lot to be desired. I was seated promptly by the hostess, who had a bright, beautiful smile, and served me my water right away. 15 minutes later, I had lots of time to peruse the small menu, but I still hadn’t seen a server. While the menu is not large, it does have good variety, with some unusual dishes tossed in. The supervisor finally came over and took my order, apologizing for the waitress who was quite busy. I found this rather strange, as there was a large conference in town, and there were lots of attendees staying at the hotel. You would think they would have made sure their staffing levels were sufficient to properly serve guests. Anyway, I ordered the Bryan Farms chicken, which was delicious. About 15 minutes after my order was taken, my server walked by an introduced herself on the way by. No apology for the slow service, just her name (which I promptly forgot) and that she would take care of me for the rest of the evening. That was the last time I saw her. It took about 20 minutes for my food to arrive, not completely unreasonable, but I was never offered any bread, even though I saw bread baskets on most of the other tables. I was only drinking water, and I had to flag down a bus person and ask before I got my water refreshed. \\nAfter dinner, I sat with an empty plate for about 10 minutes before my empty dishes were cleared, again by the supervisor. The supervisor left my table with my dishes, then remembered to return and ask me if I wanted to order desert – which I did. Serving tables was obviously not this guy’s job, but I have to give him an A for effort – he really did try. I had some chocolate concoction which was really sweet and very yummy! I never did get a refill of my coffee, even though I sat with an empty cup for about 15 minutes. I finally gave up and got up to leave. I had to ask the hostess to get my bill so I could pay it as I never did see anyone at my table again so I could to ask for it. \\nAll in all, food was great, service appears to be somewhat inconsistent.\",\n",

About a half hour or so cab ride from either of the Houston airports. Reception staff very helpful and welcoming. Room was clean, spacious and nicely decorated and furnished, free wifi, with a huge bathroom, separate bath and shower. Enjoyed the food - breakfast and dinner - and the bar service was good too. There are some restaurants within walking distance and the hotel is right by the metro tram station which is hamdy to get to the museum district. Overall I found this to be a really nice place with excellent staff. The only puzzle - and maybe I am missing something here (in which case please excuse me!) - had I not been on a business trip, I would've been at a loss for something to do in Houston as a tourist because the place seemed really quiet over the weekend - but that's not the hotel's fault of course!\",\n",

Room was provided with coffee maker, coffee, bottled water, and even 1/2 and 1/2 so you could have a decent cup of coffee in the room. Bathroom spacious and well-provided. Common spaces were spacious and relatively un-chaotic. We had a recption in their restuarant Quatro and it was well done. I had a relaxing breakfast in the same restuarant next morning. Our meeting room was also comfortable and well appointed. This part of Houston is typical modern downtown - hotels, convention center, offices, etc. An advantage was the large upscale grocery store across the street - a great alternative for fresh food when you get tired of hotel and meeting fare. The one downside is that the grocery store doesn't open until 9 AM on weekends. Runners have convenient access to Buffalo bayou park. All in all, a good experience.\",\n",

Just a 3minute walk to the subway and get on the 2 or 3 express train downtown which takes 3 minutes and you are in Times Square. One more stop and you are in 34th Street at Macy\\'s. The hotel itself was excellent. Very friendly staff who will help you with any question. The room was big with the kitchenette. The bed was very comfortable.\\nYou can also choose to eat junk food or very healthy as there are numerous gourmet supermarkets across the road which are so much better than Coles or Woolworths. Down the raod is \"Big Nicks\" diner which is open late at night after the theatre has finished. \\nWhen travelling on the subway get the $29.00 seven day pass. You can see all of the New York sights via the subway. The subway is very easy to use as well. Took no time to pick it up.\\nWalk the streets around here and you will find some lovely boutiques which are way cheaper than prices in Australia.

The lighting could have been improved in the closet areas but the touch button controls were unique and easy to use.\\nCons: Couple of small issues could be corrected to have made this a much better stay. The hot water in the shower was very hit or miss (often too hot or too cold), the free mini bar was a nice touch but the beer was never restocked after our first night, we took a house car to a Broadway show and the driver didn't know where it was (despite being only a few blocks away and costing $40), we weren't provided a comforter and pillows for the pull out bed until the second night. Closet space was a bit limited in the bedroom. Door man was non existent at the main entrance, which was puzzling for a such an expensive and trendy hotel.\\nPros: After reading the check in reviews I was a bit nervous, but our went smoothly. I used the web check in earlier in the day and was greeted promptly when we arrived. A porter took our luggage, brought us right to the room and explained the amenities to us. I will note that we didn't check in until 8:30pm so it was rather slow in the lobby area. After leaving my keys in the room 3 times, I was given replacement keys each time with a courteous smile. The location of the hotel is excellent. Just a short walk to Bryant Park, Time Sq., Rockefeller Center, Broadway and plenty of excellent shopping. Breakfast is good but expensive. I expected this for room service in NYC so it wasn't an issue. \\nOverall a good stay. The hotel itself was very nice, service seemed to be the main issue.

       "  'text': \"My husband and I stayed here for our anniversary this past weekend, and it was a beautiful, low key place to be for the weekend. I don't know why there are so many complaints about the lobby--yes, it is not the Waldorf, but it is not trying to be an old-fashioned grand hotel.with gaudy chendeliers and tufted sofas with fringe, It is sleek, modern, wood-paneled, understated and elegant with a most gorgeous etched-copper tile art installation behind the desk which is almost worth the price of staying overnight itself. Everything is quiet, and no-drama. Our room, a superior king, was on the small side, but well -designed and well-equipped. The bathrooms, dripping with quartz surfaces; read cool and understated again, with a TV behind the mirror, and sumptuous absorbent robes. The tub was wonderfully deep, and the Grohe fixtures beautiful. The Duxiana beds were sleek and low to the ground,(others had a problem with this, I didn't) and oh so comfortable. I loved that you could actually open the windows and feel the breeze outside. The room's ac/heating was the most incredibly sophisticated system I have ever encountered. Whether the heat or AC was on you could not hear the system working, yet it achieved the correct temperature quickly, as if by magic.The room was soundproof, and the hallways serpentine, so that some rooms don't even face other rooms accross the hall. There were only a couple of negatives--we were never given the soft pretzels I read about and was so looking forward to after my long day hiking all over Manhattan, the personal assistants were sometimes very difficult to reach--the phone would ring off the hook, and the room had not one color photograph or print, or other art item to punctuate the sort-of monochromatic color scheme in the rooms.Other than that, I found the staff welcoming, warm and personable, as well as highly professional. We even had a view of the Empire State Building from our room--a sight which is wonderfully emblematic of NYC.If you can afford the rates, and likea cool, modern vibe, this is a great place to stay in Midtown.\",\n",

Complimentary wifi, which is a nice touch. Only points of concern: the smaller rooms are indeed cozy. If I weren't traveling solo, I'd opt for something larger.

We arrived early and were given a room right away even if our intended room wasnt ready yet. Room itself was very pleasant, large windows and light colors. Didnt feel trapped at all as in so many other NYC hotels. Windows were well insulated and kept out the noise of the city while allowing a good view (even if quite dirty). Bathroom was large, good shower pressure and nice products. Bed was both soft and comfortable which is usually a contradiction to me. We are not tv consumers by any means but noted that the hotel had a pay per view service for movies, which felt a little weird in that type of hotel. A free media library (norm in so many places) would have been better and allowed the hotel to focus on the hospitality business and not movie rental. \\nGym is quite good and spacious and staff easy going but also professional. \\nI would recommend the hotel to any business traveler and families with children alike.',\n",

In the end, good marketing is a great tool but buyer be warned.

The towels were remarkable... how do they get them to feel so rough? The windows were small and our view toward the back of the hotel was a darkened alley.\\nThe staff was great... Very friendly and helpful. I\\'ll thank them for their excellent service. \\nThe complimentary breakfast was not great. The pastries were bland in keeping with a theme that included only two cereals - Corn Flakes and Rice Krispies.

We stayed in the most inexpensive category of room but it was large and luxurious. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the bathroom spacious and beautifully appointed.

Restaurant is is not intended to impress, though quite acceptable. I did not encounter any noise problems. WiFi worked fine for me. About half the price of a typical four star Hilton. Seamless checkout. \\nCampus is pretty safe - though a friend warned me not to venture outside the campus at all even by a block on foot - especially at night. Pretty good advice for most of Houston I'd say, but he did make a point of telling me twice in this case. \\nWhen you run into a problem, ( and it's quite possible you will ), simply notify them about it and they are understanding and accommodating and will do their best to fix it immediately.

       "  'text': \"I found this hotel on Travelocity. It had good ratings and looked like a boutique hotel with personality. While the hotel interior was beautiful and the rooms unique, there were a few quirks. For example you had to Valet park your car and couldn't get anything out of the vehicle without calling for valet service. You couldn't get ice from a machine, but had to call for room service. You couldn't borrow a cart to load or unload, you had to have someone load/unload for you. I paid extra to get a room with a jacuzzi tub. Took forever to fill, only to find out the tube jets were broken. The clock couldn't be re-set and was flashing four hours behind the time. When I called the desk, they couldn't tell me how to fix it, you got it, they'd send a maid up to check it out. All that, for a price that was above average. I have to say though, that the staff was this surreal type of friendly. Like they were programmed with the same friendly responses. Better than being yelled and smirked at I guess? To their defense, the woman who booked the room for me was very accommodating. She got permission for my 60 lb. dog to stay when they usually only accept dogs under 35lbs. Of course there was an additional charge, and restrictions, but was pleased she went the extra step to allow my dog. Nice property all-in-all if you are wanting something with more personality. Absolutely loved that they had a Texas rubber duck waiting for you in the bathroom with some great soaps. The rooms was very cozy and relaxing. The city view was beautiful. The location was great for downtown nightlife and there was a nice park/walking area two blocks away, which my dog loved. I'd stay there again. Travel on...\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I stayed at the Four Seasons in Hosuton this May for four nights on a business trip. I was attending a convention at the nearby George Brown Convention Center.\\nThis was my second visit to Houston, and by and large I can see a huge difference. The area around the Convention Center has been cleaned up (and that includes the hotel location). They've planted a park with trees, flowers, a pond and even a tea house. So Houston is definitely moving beyond its image of being a city of heat, dust and ugly concrete. The walk from the hotel to the Convention Center is short, and crosses part of the new park, so overall it feels like being in the same complex. This is a great plus and Houston is a city that is very spread out and where you can easily lose a lot of time travelling, even to places that are supposedly close by.\\nThe hotel is also well located for other attractions in Downtown Houston. The main shopping street is just some blocks away (but honestly speaking not all that interesting, so I wouldn't go there). There are a number of neat bars some of the back streets around the hotel so those are well worth popping into. Also around the corner is the Houston Pavillions, a collection of themed restaurants and music bars all in one building. So you'll have no trouble spending your free time when you're here. I also recommend taking a walk around some of the older parts of Houston which are roughly North and West of the hotel. Personally I was impressed by the different architectural and historical styles. Most recommendable is the Gulf Building (also called Morgan Chase Building) which is an architectural landmark (you can go on a tour). They also seem to be cleaning other parts of Houston up as there is quite a lot of building and renovation going on and much of the ugliness there used to be is gone. One down side, and this has definitely increased since last time I was in Houston, is the number of homeless people and beggars roaming the streets, carrying their belongings in big bags. You see them all day but they seems to get more at night. They aren't dangerous or aggressive but it's still a sorry and uncomfortable sight.\\nAnother thing I can recommend is taking a ride on the Metro. Despite what it's name suggests this is not a traditional metro with tunnels but a streetcar that runs through the streets of Houston and is an interesting way to see different parts of the city, passing several major parks, green areas, universities and other points of interest, and is also a great venue for people watching.\\nThe hotel is quite easy to find. The architecture is a bit nondescript, but difficult to miss nonetheless. The doors were opened for me by a doorman and the receptionist helped me immediately. Besides the hotels and bars I mentioned previously, the hotel has several bars/restaurants of its own. I later tried the one downstairs. Although it was very late at the time (I guess it must have been the early hours of the morning), I was surprised they could still get me something to eat. The choice of drinks was also surprisingly good for a hotel bar and the barman very professional and knowledgeable about it. It was a bit lacking in atmosphere though as most other people there were serious business types and they went to bed quite early.\\nThe hotel has a gym and even an outdoor pool but I only had a quick look at those as I didn't have time for more. Especially the pool did look very inviting, so if I ever come back I'll try and spend some time there. My room was higher up. The view from the window was idionymous with what much of Houston is about. In the foreground a massive expanse of derelict land, temporarily used for car parking, further away some buildings that looked as if they were soon to be torn down. I later discovered there are many more places like these. This is the surreal contrast that typifies Houston: Fancy hotels and many modern skyscrapers that are the HQs of multinationals, and right next door derelict plots and ruined buildings. It makes me wonder how the economics of all that works, and why the people who own what must be very expensive land don't do anything with it. \\nThe room itself was good but nothing extraordinary. The bed was comfortable though and everything was clean. I didn't check out the minibar, but the ice cubes were filled up every day. Despite being in the middle of Houston, the room was very quiet and I think i slept very well. The bathroom was very tastefully designed, with lots of patterned tiles emanating a warm feeling, making you want to spend a lot of time there.\\nI think the rooms have free WiFi, but I didn't get around to testing that. \\nAll in all, the hotel was very well run. The staff were good, the hotel was extremely clean and I can find no fault with any part of it. The interior decoration is on the whole tasteful and makes you feel at ease. The location is also good.\",\n",

The bedrooms were spacious and the lounge area had a lot of room to move around, even once you put the sofa bed up. The kitchen is small but adequate and when staying for 6 nights it was nice to be able to make breakfasts and heat things up for dinner. There was lots of storage space so we weren't tripping over our cases. The only thing which could be improved would be to have more hooks to hang towels in the bathroom but aside from that we were extremely happy with the Beacon. The staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms clean. The location was excellent. Fairways market was across the road for breakfast supplies and there were lots of restaurants and cafes within a short walk. The subway station was a two minute walk and it was only a 5 minute walk to Central Park and a 25 min walk to Times Square. Was really nice to be in a residential area that was quiet, yet close to everything. Will definately stay at the Beacon when we come back to New York.\",\n",

The problems I had with the hotel are the same problems many reviewers have noted, which concerns me since they don't appear to be being addressed. I'll start with the cons (problem areas): 1) Check-in in has major issues - I initially attempted to check in at 11 am, there was no room available so they took our bags and told us to come back. They said they would work on getting us a high room as I requested. I ended up getting a room on the 4th floor...not high in my book, but I'm assuming it is the highest they had available. Anyhow, they called at around 4 to let me know my room was ready. We came back in the early evening to check in and that is when things took a turn. Check in was chaotic despite the fact that there was only one other couple checking in at the same time. The young man asked us for our name, handed us our key and that was it. No description of the property or amenities, no maps or questions about why we were visiting, no introduction or mention of the concierge, no offer to help us with our bags, nothing. The whole ordeal was a bit cold and unprofessional. 2) The staff is very young and trendy, which fits the hotel vibe, and always smile, but there is just a warmth that is missing. There also seems to be a real lack of organization. The staff always seem to be running around, but not necessarily helping you when you need it. Out of the three days we were there, a staff member opened the front door for us 1 time. That is unacceptable when I am paying $400 a night. I highly recommend management start instituting stations that people must man at all times instead of running around frantically. A person at the front door at all times and a person at the check-in desk at all times is a must. 3) No closet space. The hotel is trendy, I get it and I've stayed at other hotels with similar concepts, but none with this little storage space. No drawers and only a tiny glass closet space to hang a few item and 4) the bed was ok, definitely not the comfiest I've ever slept in.\\nPros: Room was very, very clean and the view of the public library was nice. The minibar in the room was a nice touch since it offered free snacks and non-alcoholic drinks. The room was quiet despite facing 5th avenue. Location was awesome.\\nI stay in NYC at least 2x a year and I doubt I will be going back to this hotel. For the $ I think there are better options with more personal service. If it works out the kinks, I think ti would be a great place to stay.\",\n",

The Andaz, a boutique hotel that is trying a bit too hard to be trendy, was a failure for us. It started out a bit weak. The hotel is difficult to find with no discernable marking and only one spot out front. Nevertheless they managed to take the car after we doubleparked and brought in the luggage. They have the oh-so-cool kiosks with young staff dressed in black. We were in quickly. The room was ok, nice modern bathroom, obligatory impossible to figure out lighting and minimal free snacks. But ok.\\nNice big bedand we had a good sleep. Excellent breakfast. Brought our stuff down and checked it with the bellmen and told them to keep our car until later. Got the claim checks and went out for the day. When we checked out at 4 the chaos began. They charged us $300 for a late check out (we left at 11:30). The brought us the wrong luggage. Then the wrong car! (worse then mine so I sent it back). They tried to console us but the damage was done. Pay a little more attention to service and a little less to trying to be hip (impossible in NYC--the hotel is so 2010). Please, no canned management comment about how sorry you are.

       "  'text': \"We came to NYC for a weekend wedding, one week after Sandy hit the east coast. So I think maybe some of my negative reviews were related to that. Anyways, here's what I think of this hotel: \\nPros: decent sized room-I requested a corner unit because we had a dog with us, and didn't want to disturb neighbors. It's not the largest room I've stayed in NYC, but definitely the room with the highest ceiling and the largest bathroom. The minibar in the room has soda and sparkling water, all complimentary. In-room service was fast. Staff was nice to me, but per my husband, he walked right after me into the hotel and nobody acknowledged him. \\nCons: dirty carpet, which was my biggest complaint. I was appalled to see those stains, for a five-star establishment like this, how can you have stains on the carpet? Second complaint, we needed cabs on several occasions, nobody offered to get us a cab at first, then I remembered this happened twice--after we stood outside for like 5 minutes, someone finally came to help us, but was either at the same time chatting with someone else, or really not trying as hard as I'd like to. Third and last complaint, when we checked out, we waited in line for 10 min, because there was only one girl at front desk. \\nMaybe it's post-hurricane and people were still recovering, or maybe this is what this hotel truly is, but the whole time, I felt like Setai was under-staffed at front desk and outside the door. Dirty carpet was unacceptable to me, staff was nice to me but not to my husband. And minimal help on getting a cab. For those reasons, I don't think I'd return.\",\n",

When we arrived, they unfortunately were closed due to heating problems caused by Hurricane Sandy so we had to go elsewhere for our first night. The staff on duty were very apologetic and assisted us in getting to another hotel.\\nThankfully, we were able to return on day two, so spent the rest of our trip there. We had booked a Capella room and asked for a high floor. We stayed in room 1401 which was massive......and I mean huge! The bed was six foot wide and was lost in the room. We overlooked Fifth Avenue and the Chrysler Building. The room had a decent sized seating area with a sofa and two armchairs and the bed. There was a dressing room which had two double open wardrobes and drawers. This then lead into a huge marble bathroom, with twin basins and plenty of countertop space. Shower was vast with two shower heads. You honestly have to see this room to appreciate the space. I do not like small hotel rooms and hate when your cases sit in the corner on open view, which serves to remind that you are going home.....no issues here though - suitcases were well hidden from view.\\nThe Bar on Fifth has a nice, relaxed atmosphere and has jazz bands playing every night.\\nLocation of the hotel is great for going to the various sights of NYC in both lower and midtown Manhattan.\\nHad a serious personal issue during stay. Brian Fahey, Concierge Manager, was absolutely fabulous with his assistance. He always made sure that he kept up to date with the situation and it helped me feel a little more relaxed. \\nManaged to use the hotel car (a Maserati) a couple of times - nice touch of luxury.\\nOur room was right next to the lift shaft but we could not hear any noises. The room is at the end of the corridor with one other room and is a fair distance away from other rooms, so no disruptions from others walking past.\\nDid not eat in the hotel (apart from room service late one night, which was good). Plenty of coffee shops, etc nearby for breakfasts.\\nThe Nespresso machine and complimentary mini bar (soft beverages) was a nice touch. Have been in plenty of high end hotels which did not have this. There have been some previous comments bout these not being replenished when used but a quick call to Guest Services soon sort that out.\\nWould definitely recommend to others and would stay here again on our return.',\n",

And very high tech. And we did not receive an orientation to the room. So we could not figure out simple things, like turning the lights on and off. We actually never figured out one of the lights so we just unscrewed the lightbulbs every night. On our second day we requested and received an orientation, which was very helpful, so we could used all of the \"special features\" of the toilet. In case it appears we are completely inept, we are not....the toilet actually had to be reset so that the bidet features would work. But the toilet still malfunctioned twice in our three-day visit so that engineering had to come to reset it. So it was a little too high tech for our tastes. Also, we paid for the terrace, which is completely useless unless you are a smoker. Otherwise you would not want to spend time there since it is close to the HVAC unit so very noisy and no view. Lastly, both bars and the restaurant were completely unavailable beginning at 4pm on one of our nights because the Food Network was using the location. It would have been nice if guests of the hotel were offered a complimentary glass of wine or something for the inconvenience. So overall, given the high cost of rooms in this hotel, even with the great location and great staff, we would not stay here again.',\n",

       "  'text': \"We had 2 rooms at the Chatwal over Labor Day weekend to enjoy the City and the US Open. I had requested that one of the rooms have 2 beds, and that request was accomodated. If that is important to you, be aware that you may get a handicapped-accessible room. For us that was not a problem. The staff was excellent, welcoming us, introducing us to the Butler and bell staff, and making sure our checking was simple. They were also attentive and helpful throughout the rest of the stay. Our room had a quirk in that you could not turn on/off all the lights from the entry light panel. I hope this will be analyzed and fixed. The room was very comfortable and overall quiet. We faced to street and got some expected street noise, but given the location it wasn't bad. The only problem we had was the WiFi. I had almost no signal in my room and my companions had no signal in their room at the other end of the floor. If you are staying for business you will probably need to plug in to the connection, which I did not try. For a smartphoone or iThing you will have an issue. Otherwise, the staff and room was excellent and we plan on staying here again.\\nNote that this is not a highrise hotel. It's a very old building (for US standards). You will have no view of anything.\",\n",

We arrived after 24 hours of travel from Auckland, New Zealand to stay for 11 nites, 3rd Oct till 14th Oct. What a superb hotel, right from check in to our entire stay. We had a room on the 8th floor which was large and luxurious and not to mention the very spacious bathroom. Amenities in room,gorgeous Asprey products. Very quiet,no noise. Great location to theatre district and shopping,very convenient. One of my birthday gifts was a hot stone massage treatment at the Elizabeth Arden spa, simply sensational after lugging all those shopping bags around.:-) Lobby bar and the first floor bars,excellent to entertain friends in a gorgeous atmosphere. We will surely highly recommend this hotel to our friends and family visiting New York. We travel frequently and find this hotel among one of the best.

Told us would be $75 inc tip but when we arrived at JFK would not take any less than $95.

       "  'text': 'My wife, two kids, and my mother-in-law stayed in a suite at this hotel. Check in was a breeze, no need to wait in a long line or anything like that. The room was excellent for the price, compared to the normal, puny-sized rooms of New York. There were 2 separate rooms, one with a king bed and one with a sofa bed. The sofa bed was a queen bed, so it was big enough to fit two people, but for our convenience, they brought in an extra roll-in bed for us. One of the best things about this hotel was that its room service almost immediately brought you whatever you wanted. For example, I asked for more towels and shampoo before I showered, and they delivered them in less than two minutes. The breakfast was rather simple, but the quality was still good. Sometimes it got so crowded that you had to wait in a line to get in. The breakwast was also light, hence the name \"continental breakfast,\" with a wide variety of pastries, breads, yogurts, etc. The hotel\\'s location was very good, right next to the Waldorf Astoria and a short walk to Saks Fifth Avenue. One negative of this hotel was that the dining portion of the room service was not 24/7, and it was only Indian food. The staff was also extremely kind and welcoming. The concierge performed magic tricks for my 5 year old son and gave him chocolates, which brightened up his trip a bit. Overall, this hotel was a successful pick, and I would recommend it to both people and families who are looking for quality, not necessarily luxury.',\n",

It was a little expensive, but all hotels will be. The restaurant staff seemed a little preoccupied as well. I had to wait when I wanted to get my check one night for about ten minutes, because it seemed like it was closing time.\\nThe front desk staff, however, was amazing and attentive. Tremaine is a great asset to this hotel, and she is actually part of the school's graduate program! The other people that were there too were so so nice and I haven't experienced customer service like that in a long time. When I wanted a taxi, they called one right away for me and actually walked me out to the taxi and made sure it was going to the right destination, etc... They also are great in coversation. They really care about what they're doing and stop what they're doing in order to help you. They make you feel right at home! \\nI didn't use many of their other amenities or know if there were any, but it was a very nice and peaceful place that offered a coffee maker in the room, will bring a refridgerator right up to you (houseman was extremely nice as well) and all free of charge!\\nIf I come to stay and look at the campus again, I will definitely be staying here, it is very convenient and made my trip a lovely place to stay!\\nThank you to all of the front desk staff for making my trip comfortable, exciting and great overall!\",\n",

Unfortunately the expected services for this new Marriott Collection of hotels fell short. Front desk personnel were very pleasant and helpfull with directions but there was no concierge at all. Apparently, they offer turndown service but only on request, and I only found out by reading this right before checking out. Room service trays were left in the hallways for hours and I should not have to ask for toilet paper , liquid soap and tissues to be restocked after the room is made up for the day. This was the first time that I can remember that a newspaper was not left at my door as a Marriott Rewards member , although they were available at the front desk. All in all the hotel was ok but there was very little to make it special.',\n",

(Getting there at 6am was not early enough for front row, fyi! Next time: 5 am). Our 2 room King suite was spacious (for NYC), the kitchenette well equipped; the bathroom had a great powerful shower with plenty of hot water (but no exhaust fan - got pretty steamy with 3 adults showering in a row). Very nice furnishings, clean and well-maintained. 2 big TVs; docking station for iPods. Our low-floor room was great given that the elevators can be slow. I never knew about the laundry room that others have mentioned here; I add that to the list of things the staff couldn\\'t be bothered with telling us. Along with: no parking garage within 10 blocks will let you park overnight over Thanksgiving (we ended up at Lincoln Center 12 blocks away, on a tip from a guy at the 6th garage we tried); even though checkin is at 3pm, that doesn\\'t necessarily mean 3, it might mean 4:30; (because \"it\\'s really busy\" - now I know to only expect what I pay for when it\\'s slow). I know it\\'s been a while since I\\'ve been to NY, because I noticed the lack of pleasantries, such as \"good morning\" from a doorman or \"Did you enjoy you stay?\" from the front desk. Ah well. It\\'s a nice place and you\\'ll love it if you want to stay in a quieter part of the city, without being too far away from things.

Did not try to restaurant or bar area, but the lobby was always a buzz with people.

For breakfast I opted to go outside rather than use the hotel with Pret, Starbucks and a deli right outside. \\nOverall, this is a great hotel with excellent staff and facilities and I would definitely recommend it, but, being a 5 star hotel is a bit on the expensive side, even compared to other 5 star hotels I ve stayed in, you can probably get something in NY very similar for a bit cheaper.\",\n",

They have to be the nicest staff in a hotel we have ever come across. Not staged or phoney and couldn't do enough for you. Jackie and your team you are a credit to your hotel! As a result of the hurricane the power was out in a lot of New York, the hotel staff, whilst extremely restricted as to what they could do to make everyone feel comfortable without power, sprung into action with back up plans to ensure all guests were looked after. There was a skeleton crew on during the hurricane who worked extremely hard and, whilst they were exhausted, still managed to go beyond the call of duty. The hotel is in an ideal location on 5th avenue, beautifully furnished, food excellent and attention to detail was top notch. We will more than happily stay here again. What a wonderful experience! x\",\n",

Our room was very attractive, new (I believe about 2 years old), spacious and fresh. The toilet seat had more controls than some airplanes I flew in 50 years ago. Lots of outlets for charging and closet space worthy of a home. A continental breakfast was included, I believe the credit was $34 for each of us. If you sit near the gas fireplace it can be a bit warm. I mentioned this once and we were quickly and politely offered another table. On Mondays and Tuesdays they have a jazz pianist on the 2nd floor bar. If you're feeling flush, try the Nolet's Reserve gin martini, $100 for a 2 oz. pour. Maybe on my next trip.\",\n",

The bed was very comfortable and requests for additional towels and bath products were promptly honored. Our room was on the 12th floor facing busy 6th Avenue, but was very quiet with little street noise...always a plus in NYC. The bathroom was a nice size, but unfortunately there was only a very large shower and no tub. We could have used more room for toiletries in the sink area, but one doesn't want to get too picky when writing these reviews. The in-room safe was large and always appreciated. The staff was genuinely friendly and courteous.\\nThe hotel is adjacent to interesting neighborhoods, but is located on a rather nondescript block of 6th Avenue. It is very close to Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, the Empire State Building and Macy's. The 'R' subway line is 2 blocks away at 28th and Broadway and serves all of mid-town and lower Manhattan....easy for any tourist to master in one day.\\nThe spa was booked when I called for an appointment to get a massage, but the spa manager requested that the masseur stay an additional hour to accommodate my request. This was very much appreciated and illustrated the hotels desire to please a guest in need.\\nThe only very small snafu was when we tried to order ice one night around 11pm....they were swamped with requests from other guests arriving back from the theater. They were very apologetic for the delay, however, it took about 20 minutes or so for the ice to arrive. They provide complimentary coffee and tea in the hotel lobby in the morning until 9am....it would be nice if they could keep it out until 10am.\\nI would recommend this hotel for business travelers and tourists alike.\",\n",

Patrick at the front desk gave me an upgrade so that I wouldn't have to wait for my room to be ready, and a $15 free mini-bar card for becoming an In Touch Member. Kevin in Maintenance was also a big help.\\n3. The shower is bright and big and has a wonderful rain-shower head as well as a hand-held shower-head. (unfortunately, the floor was very slippery when wet!! Not a good thing)\\n4. Beautiful, big, flat screen, high-def TV.\\n5. Excellent hair dryer.\\n6. Large closet with plenty of hangers, shelves, and a safe. Robes to use if you want.\\n7. Big full-length mirror.\\nNow the BAD things:\\n The room is INSANELY DARK after the sun goes down. I needed my flashlight to unpack my suitcase and to work at the desk. And trying to get them to bring an extra lamp was like pulling teeth!! I had to basically beg many different people, before someone was able to finally find a lamp!\\nThere is a nice 8 foot long desk and chair, but the unusual desk light illuminates only a tiny rectangle of space on the desk, leaving the rest of the desk in darkness. Same problem with the night table lamp that just shines directly down on a small area. And the only other lights in the room are two micro-mini recessed ceiling lights over by the window that each shine a narrow, angled beam of light directly onto the curtains. The fact that the majority of the walls are dark brown adds to the problem.\\nBelieve me, I'm all for saving electricity, but there are other ways to save electricity. In ACCOR HOTELS for example, the lights will not go on unless you put your room key in a special slot by the door when you enter. So when you go out, and take your key, it is impossible to leave the lights on.\\nAs I was looking through the items in the Mini-bar to use my gift card, I noticed that almost all the drinks and food items were expired. And in addition to snacks, the Mini-Bar also had items like a 3-Pack of CONDOMS, and PERSONAL LUBRICANT for sale! I was offended and disgusted! I would expect to see things like that at a seedy motel that you rent by the hour! \\nI'm used to reaching into the night table to read the Bible before going to bed (all Hilton Hotels have Bibles). No Bible in the Kimpton Eventi, that's for sure! \\nI couldn't wait to get out of there. Definitely not my type of place. It was creepy!\",\n",

       "  'text': 'We just returned from our one night mini-vacay from NYC, and I can\\'t wait to write about our experience staying at the San Carlos Hotel. My husband I took our sons, age 3 and 1, to NYC for a weekend trip. We truly enjoyed the hotel from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. There are three main reason why we love it, the room size, hotel amenity and the most important part, staff. My husband and I had stayed in several other hotels in the area in the past, (Affinia, Waldorf Astoria, Hilton New York and Hilton Time Square), but we found this hotel worth returning to. \\nFirst of all, the size of the room is beyond expected. It felt more like a \"home\" than a hotel room. For the average price of a mid-town Manhattan hotel, we had a true one-bedroom suite with two queen size beds. The bed room was equipped with a standard size desk and a large flat screen TV. The beds were soft yet supportive. The living room had a sofa bed, two chairs, a large TV, a dining area and a kitchenette. After sitting in the stroller all afternoon waiting for us, my boys were ready for some stretching. The room provided plenty of space for them. If there is any downside to the room, that would be the view out of the window. We didn\\'t care, since we spent most of the time exploring the city. \\nThe amenities of the room were great, especially the kitchenette. It has a small refrigerator, sink, microwave, and some basic dinnerware like bowls, plates, glasses and silverware. Don\\'t worry about bringing a cork opener, they got that, too. We brought in dinner for Sat. night, and all the items in the kitchenette made it so much easier. The breakfast was simply, yet every item was delicious. Even coffee was better than Starbucks! \\nFinally, and most importantly, I truly enjoy the people that work at San Carlos. The front desk staff were very helpful and paid special attention to each guest. The captain was very accommodating to our requests. The house keeping staff were very friendly. We truly felt welcomed at the hotel. \\nOn Sunday morning, my 3-year-old didn\\'t want to go home and wanted to stay in NYC. The whole family found this experience beyond our expectations. We are looking forward to going back soon!',\n",

       "  'text': 'We decided to stay at the San Carlos after reading mostly favorable reviews on TripAdvisor. We had a 12th floor executive suite facing 50th avenue, from 13 to 19 September.\\nHotel location is OK, many restaurants at walking distance, 2 blocks away from subway station, lots of groceries stores nearby, friendly reception staff. Housekeeping is efficient. Free internet access, I could use two devices simultaneously under the same login. No room service.\\nThe suite is large is disposes of kitchenette with microwave and fridge, although a toaster would have come in handy. It is quite comfortable for two people, with plenty of drawers and storing space, sofa and a small dining table with two chairs. Beware of the touch-sensitive mini-bar, unless you really want to pick up something. There are 2 large flat screen TV sets, but the program grid is limited to US channels: no French, German or Italian channel, which could add an international flair to the property. The bathroom has magnifying mirror, towels of good standard, satisfactory but not high-end toiletries. \\nBed is comfortable, there is a good choice of pillows, but sleep quality was greatly disturbed by persistent air-borne noise. The windows are definitely not soundproof (the site call them \"double-glazed\"), and every kind of street noise seemed to pour into the room, from shouts and whistles late at night, to police and fire sirens all night long and delivery trucks early in the morning.\\nBreakfast was better than I had expected from previous reviews. It is the usual continental type, and one would not pay less than 13 euros for it in a Parisian hotel; we would complement it upstairs with some fresh fruit bought the evening before. The breakfast room is really cramped, although that is a minor problem if you are on vacation and can manage your time schedule avoiding breakfast at peak times.\\nThe San Carlos is a nice and affordable hotel in NY, adequate for a short stay and particularly suited for families with children.',\n",

I can honestly say I have never felt more comfortable or more at home. Because it is a residence building and not an over-sized, transient hotel, it is quiet and comfortable and the location can't be beat. I agree with a previous reviewer, I did not want to leave and joked with the front desk I would call a real estate agent! Well, the Sherry does indeed have one, and her name is Theresa Nocerino. If you are in the market for a pied a terre, be sure to give her a call. Everyone at the hotel and in Cipriani's just raved about her. She made sure my every need was attended to, and the entire staff could not be more friendly. The elevator operators evoke an era gone by of service and style. If you want to feel refreshed and rested after a busy day in Manhattan, the Sherry is the place to stay. The only caveat is you may not want to leave your room, so don't overschedule yourself with appointments while visiting New York! 5 star, triple A+!!!\",\n",

The best feature by far is the indoor pool located on the 23rd floor with panoramic views of the city skyline. My kids didn't want to leave the pool. The executive lounge was very well staffed with great food options and plenty of eating. The hotel provided us with a free shuttle to the stadium and then we walked the couple of blocks back.

We booked 3 nights as this is the only hotel that has a covered bridge to the convention center so you can walk right over regardless of the weather. You can choose to self park or valet. We opted for valet at a cost of $30 a night. But there is a covered walking bridge to the parking garage next door if you want. Our room was on the Executive lounge floor with a King size bed and lots of room on the granite top writing desk. We upgraded to the Executive King room for $19.95 a night as it included WiFi ($15 a day otherwise) and access to the Executive lounge. The lounge offers private access with free continental breakfast and snacks and appetizers in the evening. Coffee and beverages included as well. An adult bar is in the lounge for an additional charge. The coffee offered is much better than the coffee you get from brewing yourself in the room. The fruit and pastries are fresh and of restaurant quality. If you want to get the most out of your stay and have added value upgrade to the Executive Lounge. I am thankful we did! PS. The blanket included on our bed was very very warm. If you like a cool night's sleep as we do just use covered sheets as the comforter will lock in all your heat.\",\n",

But that 4 block walk, and however many more to your destination within downtown, can be brutal during the searingly hot and humid period between early June and late September. It\\'s location is immediately adjacent to Freedman\\'s Town in the 4th ward, an area just beginning to transition from old, delapidated wooden homes and bad street surfaces to \"gentrification\". Walking some of the streets late night might not be prudent. There is a secure parking area to the front and the rear of the property.\\nAll of the rooms are suite-sized, much larger than is typical. Lots of room. Room decor is a step up from the usual blandness of most hotels, quite attractive. The room and bath were super clean. Carpet is just a bit frayed though. The beds are very comfy and soft, which I prefer. Some don\\'t. Had a very nice white comforter, not one of those nasty bedspread things.\\nThere\\'s a microwave and refrigerator in each room. And a 42\" HDTV. BUT... no HDTV service. Go figure. They spent more than is normal in designing and furnishing the rooms, then won\\'t bother to pay for HDTV service.\\nThe bath was very clean, but average in size and design. The towels were excellent, very fluffy. BUT... no exhaust vent. Why do so many mid-to-upscale hotels not install bathroom exhaust vents?\\nThe air conditioner was very efficient and quick in establishing whatever temperature we set it for. And was very quiet in doing so. Had an excellent nights sleep. \\nThere\\'s a nice pool, but it\\'s situated a bit oddly. Most of the pool and surrounding lounging area are under the hotel\\'s second floor, with no sun access. There is one small area at one end of the pool that does get sun from midday until early evening.\\nThere is an excellent full breakfast. Which is fortunate since there\\'s no nearby dining or shopping places.\\nAll in all, a very good place to sleep well near downtown, but it\\'s very overpriced. After all, it\\'s just a Best Western Plus. For the same price or a few bucks more a room can be booked at nearby hotels that are actually within downtown such as the Doubletree.',\n",

How can you say it is a quiet room when you have traffic noise in your room (although almost white noise due to the constant traffic) and a building site outside that starts promptly at 7 (thankfully I was here a business guest and was up at this time). The look the owners have gone for is obviously a “boutique hotel” which they have managed, although the build quality isn’t to impressive nor the materials. Everything seems glossy but cheap and for instance the tiles seem to have been placed by a person just learning the trade. The bed and pillows are good though and it does look good if you don’t look too closely and the location is great for restaurants, bars and shopping.

We were delighted with our stay and were made to feel more than welcome from every staff member we met. The hotel is in an ideal location, just steps from Times Square and Fifth Avenue is very close by too. The hotel is very quiet and we heard no noise from outside whilst in our room during our stay. Our room was simply breathtaking. It was very luxurious and we were so comfortable. It has very nice touches to it such as a tv in the bathroom mirror to suede Walls! We used the concierge service which was very professional. Juan booked our helicopter trip for us and advised on which day and time would suit best after he reviewed the weather forecast which was much appreciated. Overall this hotel is a little gem with the most professional and friendly staff I have ever come across in a hotel. Go ahead and treat yourselves like we did you will not regret it.',\n",

They have a laundry room and a pool. It's really a nice place to stay. They charge only $4.99 for Internet for your entire stay. There's extended cable TV with Showtime and HBO, a full kitchen, large bathroom, desk area, hair dryer, and iron and ironing board. For one person it's awesome, for three, it wasn't even crowded. I really enjoyed my stay and would highly recommend it to anyone needing a longer term at a good price. It is definitely priced right for what you get.

Our room was HUGE, a nice king bed, clean sheets, a/c very cold, big screen tv with cable, hbo and movie channels. The room also had a fridge, microwave, complimentary water, coffee and cookies. There is a pool outside, one downside is there is not access from the inside of the hotel making it a bit less user friendly, though it is very clean and well maintained. The have a complimentary breakfast with several choices including eggs, waffles, sausage, cereal, biscuits and gravy, fruit, raisins etc. I still think the price is much too high but compared to other hotels downtown I found it to be very reasonable.

One of the things that I find so amazing about the Sherry is that I find myself never asking for anything, because they have already thought of everything. The rooms are enormous, comfortable, the staff is attentive and lovely, I love the fact that beverages and wifi are included. The soaking tub and bathrooms are awesome.

It was during fashion week, so the hotel was full ( I only know this because some of my colleagues were trying unsuccessfully to stay there). It did not feel like there were a lot of people staying there so it is very quiet. The location is great, near the subway and getting cabs were no problem either.\\nI actually had a suite (I guess they upgraded me) and it was very roomy. Maybe all of the room are suites. Needless to say, I was not expecting a large room in a New York “boutique” hotel so I was pleasantly surprised. The bed was comfortable the staff very pleasant and the bathrooms clean, well appointed and roomy. They also offer complimentary breakfast and free WiFi.',\n",

       "  'text': \"I booked this room via Priceline. I was given a room on a floor that was being painted and the smell was terrible. All I wanted to do was take a long bath and relax in my room. My weird little room didn't have a bathtub, and just a drain in the floor with a shower head attached to the wall -- no walls or stall around the shower. The paint fumes were so bad that I couldn't relax in the room. When I called the front desk and asked to be moved, I was told that as I had booked thru Priceline, a move would be considered an up charge. I was quoted a charge of $40, just to be moved to a room with a bathtub. They also said they could not be sure that my new room would be away from the paint fumes. I declined to pay the $40 for the move, and to escape the fumes I went down to the bar to watch a little TV. I had a few drinks and cleared my tab and went to bed. In the morning, I looked at the bill that was slipped under my door and saw that someone else's bar tab had been charged to my room to the tune of $147! \\nI took a shower in the weird cattle trough area, which got the entire bathroom floor wet. I then spent the next 30 minutes coaxing the water down the drain with towels so that I could dry my hair without standing in inches of water. Upon check out I argued my bill and got the rogue charges removed, however, it took the Hotel Icon almost a week to credit my account the $147. \\nI WILL NEVER, EVER STAY AT THE HOTEL ICON AGAIN -- it was a horrendous experience.\",\n",

I was very disappointed and it wasn't like this the last time I stayed at the hotel. Plastic disposable cutlery and plates are not what I expected for a self-described 'boutique hotel'.

       "  'text': 'We were back again to stay at the San Carlos. It had been a few years since our last stay and apparently it had become more popular since then because of all the good reviews. I guess it is a hidden gem no more! My grown daughters say that they will stay no where else when they are in New York City. Once again, the San Carlos did not disappoint.\\nWhen we arrived, Gabriel (I think-no name tags) at the desk immediately greeted us with humor. Since it was my husband with me and our two daughters, he referred to my husband as \"Charlie\" the entire time and we were the \"angels\". We had booked a standard two queen bed room but Gabriel said that we were in a king room suite with a small kitchen at the same rate. I asked about the bed situation and he said that if my daughters were unhappy with the sofabed that we could switch. He assured them that the matresses were new and comfortable. \\nOur suite was very spacious and we loved the kitchen area. We seemed to be facing out to a street but it was very quiet in our room. Besides the kitchen space, we had a little table and chairs area, two closets, a desk, two comfortable cushy chairs and a big screen TV plus the king bed! So nice for NYC. And my daughters never had a single complaint about the sofabed. I always especially like the real plants in the room and the roman shades. It seems to give such a homey touch. The bathroom was also spacious with robes, toiletries, plenty of towels and a makeup mirror, etc. We couldn\\'t think of anything they didn\\'t provide. \\nEveryone as usual was very pleasant and friendly, always greeting us when we came and went. My husband was especially pleased with how quick the bellman got our luggage up to our room-even before we left the front desk. He had to track him down to give him his tip. We saw the umbrellas lined up as usual on a rainy day but we had our own. Everyone always provided help with our questions when asked. My husband enjoys the fact that he can set up transportation to and from the airport through the San Carlos before our trip. I love the scale in the lobby to weigh your suitcases before your flight-which they do for you if you want! I travel a lot and don\\'t see a scale very often in a hotel lobby. A nice touch since I always want to know what mine weigh before I get to the airport.\\nWe love the San Carlos for its amenities and spaciousness but also for its location to 5th Ave. (a few blocks walk straight up) and the subway lines (right on the corner). We also found a great Mexican restaurant on the next block behind the hotel. Yes, the breakfast is a little lacking in variety but that doesn\\'t bother us because we are getting FREE breakfast in NYC!!\\nWhen we left, Gabriel joked with us once more and gave us free pens to take. We noticed a small boy coming in after us and he immediately started to show him a magic trick. We had to laugh! The San Carlos always makes us feel welcome and like we are part of the family returning for a visit. Until next time- we can\\'t wait!!',\n",

What a gold mine I found. Very roomy rooms, very clean. I cannot say enough great things about the staff. It was so nice to be out and about all day and come back to smiling, welcoming faces. Yes it is their job to care, but they sincerely did. The hotel is in a wonderful quiet neighborhood and easy to walk everywhere.

We were going to highly recommend this hotel before the storm - and afterwards we can only say thank goodness we stayed at this total gem in Midtown.\\nStaff are fabulous, rooms are very comfortable (King has much more room and better large bed than standard room so recommend king rooms). No noise from lifts or other rooms despite hotel being full. Its not trendy - its conservative and a little old fashioned but in a good comfortable way with great linen and bathrooms as well.\\nThe location is great - two blocks to the madness of Time Square and then you can retreat to this haven - or walk the other direction straight onto the shopping mecca of 5th avenue. 10 minute walk to Empire State. Breakfast in the hotel\\'s restaurant \"Triomphe\" is too formal/staid and pricey for us but it was very good food. \\nWe had our stay extended by Superstorm Sandy and I can honestly say in 20 years of travrelling the globe we have never experienced such service and dedication as the staff showed its guests during this crisis. The morning after the storm when Manhattan was closed down literally and shut off from the rest of NYC, the hotel laid on complimentary breakfast for all guests, they provided up to the minute information from airlines about flight cancellations, they made pots of coffee for guests in the lobby trying to use the internet, and despite having to sleep at work, the doormen handed out umbrellas with a smile and up to date information about what was operating or open when it was hard to find places to eat.\\nWe must mention the fabulous and friendly concierge Vanessa who was always smiling and knowledgable and sorted out anything guests asked her to including spending over an hour on the phone (helping other customers whilst she was on hold I might add!) to an airline for us trying to change our flights due to cancellations. \\nPatrick on the front desk kept his cool when faced with tired and emotional customers and was always helpful. Hotel management did the human spirited thing and made the very generous decision to allow all guests to stay on at a flat rate which was below their usual rate (unlike other operational hotels in NYC after the storm) and also to cancel additional nights up until 2pm if guests found they could actually travel out of NYC.\\nAMAZING. Total customer focus, super friendly helpful staff, and a great stay in a great location. We will always go back here when in Manhattan.',\n",

Even though it was last summer I keep telling stories about how great it was so I thought I would write a review.\\nThe night of my birthday my girlfriend and I went out for dinner. When we got back to the hotel we were sitting at the bar and asked one of the bartenders what they recommend doing for the evening. One of the managers was standing near us and offered to call a friend of his that worked at a bar. He called and told us to ask for the manager when we got to the bar. When we got there the club was packed (I believe it was Bomaby which I don't think is there anymore). We told the door guy who we were and the manager came down and met us. He bought our drinks for us all night. The whole bar took care of us like we were old friends.\\nWhen we got back to the hotel there was a small chocolate birthday cake waiting for me in our room. The service is impeccable there. The hotel is amazing.\\nI recommend it all the time when I have friends going to NYC.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'We chose to stay at the Setai based on the good reviews it received. Unfortunately we did not have the same good experience. We stayed there for a week and left feeling very let down. We had the classic package that included full american breakfast. On arrival the reception staff told us that they did not have that on their system. I forwarded the email confirming we had breakfast included in the rate and the receptionist said he would send us the breakfast vouchers. What he actually sent me were vouchers for continental breakfast which is of a lower value. I had to call again to set this issue clear and finally get the correct vouchers. Unlike other hotels were they offer the most generous breakfasts at the Setai they are extremely stingy. Full breakfast to them is 2 eggs, 1 sausage, coffee and 1 Juice. For anything else you get charged extra. The free wifi is extremely slow we paid the 15 dollar extra per day. They have all the disney channels apart from Disney Junior, so that they can charge 3.99 or something for 30 minute shows for pre-schoolers. We were never told of the courtesy car they have - they never offered it to us. The room was not being cleaned thoroughly. They change sheets every 3 days. My son had smudged the floor to ceiling mirror in the closet area, those smudges stayed there for 3 days. The doormen would see us coming in with children and bags in arms - would take them quite some time to come and help us. Every night I had to deal with the cigarette smoke from the room next to us. A lot of smoke!!! The positives of the hotel were the size of the rooms, the room service food and the location.',\n",

       "  'text': \"I booked a one-bedroom suite for 2 nights at the Setai fifth avenue. I chose this hotel because it is branded as a five stars hotel, because of the flexible check-in and checkout times and finally because of the good reviews on this website. Unfortunately, even though there were positives during my stay at the Setai, it did not reach my expectations for many reasons.\\nI’ll start with the negatives.\\nFirst, they pretend on their website that the hotel has flexible check-in and checkout times. In the hotel’s guide inside my suite, it’s also clearly written that «there’s no check in and checkout times at the Setai» and that guests can request a late checkout for their date of departure. Unfortunately, this is not true. I booked this hotel for this reason because I was landing in New-York in early afternoon and leaving in the evening and I didn’t want to wait hours at the hotel bar to wait for check in. Well, that’s exactly what happened. I arrived at the hotel just before 1h00PM and they told me at the reception I had to wait until 2h30PM for my suite to be ready. No excuses, no upgrades. At 2h15, the front desk clerk reached me at the bar to tell me my suite was ready. That was a nice touch, but I was expecting my room to be ready when I arrived. Same story for checking out. I asked the front desk the day before my departure for a late checkout. They asked me what time, and when I said 6h00PM, they said it was impossible and the best they could do for me was 2h00PM. That’s unacceptable from a hotel that clearly claims they have no check-in and checkout times.\\nThe other negative is that I requested at the time of booking a high floor because I always like to have nice views when I book hotels. They gave me the 19th floor. I could say it is a high floor, but not in this case since their website says the hotel’s one bedroom suites are located between 18th and 27th floor. \\nThe third negative is the service in the room. For example, there was a lack in maid service. There were spots of dirt left after the daily maid service. Also, coffees and milks for the espresso machine were not refilled. So I had to call for a refill and it took more than half an hour to have someone come to my room even though they said someone was coming «right now». Same thing for the laundry service, the person at the phone said someone was already on her way to pick up my clothes but it took more than 15 minutes to have someone knock on my door. This same person asked me when I needed my clothes back and when I said for the next morning before 10h00AM, they replied «no problems they will be in your room before 10». They gave me back my clothes at 10h45AM without warning me they would arrive late.\\nThese are some of the small details that, alone, are not that bad. But, put together, they leave a poor impression. It is unacceptable from a five star hotel who ask their clients more than 1300$/night to stay in the type of suite I had.\\nNow, the positives.\\nFirst, the in-room dining. Although expensive, everything from the presentation to the quality of the meal was perfect.\\nWhen I needed transportation to go downtown, I asked if the chauffeured Maserati was available and it was. What an experience! The driver, I forgot his name, knows how to ride this sport car. He will get you to your destination in a very short time and don't be afraid, he is a very good driver.\\nAlso, despite the erratic service I already mentioned above, the staff is, for the majority, exceptionally friendly. They will always smile, say hello and, when they remember, they will greet you by your name. \\nConcerning the accommodation, the one-bedroom suite I had was very nice. It was nicely decorated and very spacious. These suites are equipped with washer/dryer, fridge, microwave, oven, etc. It really feels like you are at home. Also, the TV in the bathroom is a nice touch. \\nIn conclusion, I would have given this hotel 3.5 stars. But since I can’t give a half star, I give the Setai 4 stars because that’s the number this hotel should have in reality. A 5 stars hotel is, in my opinion, close to perfection. Unfortunately, the Setai Fifth Avenue failed in many departments as stated above. It is still a very good hotel, but it costs too much for what you get in return.\\nFor all these reasons, I do not think I will come back at this hotel. I’m ready to pay a lot a money for service but I expect to get what I pay for which was not the case at the Setai. For the same price, next time I’ll try the Trump International hotel or the Mandarin Oriental.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"We were originally supposed to stay at Andaz 5th Ave for 4nts from 27 Oct, but due to hurricane Sandy, ended up having to extend our stay until 04 Nov. \\nUpon our arrival we were greeted by Ramone who offered us wine/refreshments while he checked us in. The lobby area was quite large with a seating area/library off to one side and restaurant to the other. A few minutes later we were taken to our allocated room and shown all the amenities the room had to offer. Our room was on the 7th floor, (an XL King with view) and we had a lovely view of the library and 42nd Street. The bed was really comfortable, our son had a rollaway bed which was also comfortable. The bedroom was a good size and had a large 42inch flatscreen TV, sofa, mini fridge with complimentary snacks and non alcoholic drinks, safety deposit box, a small glass wardrobe, bedside drawers, iron & ironing board and desk with a telephone. There was a touchpad control for the lights and window blind, which was straight forward to use. It would have been handy if there was a mirror over the desk as the only other mirror in the room was next to the glass wardrobe in the entrance. It was mentioned in previous reviews about noise from the road outside, the only thing we could just about hear was the sound of police/fire engine sirens.\\nThe bathroom was lovely, it had twin sinks, the shower area had a rain shower, normal shower and footbath. We managed to work out the controls for each one after a couple of goes. There was also a hairdryer and toiletries. The only thing I would suggest to change in the bathroom is the lighting, it was rather dim. Other than that the bathroom was very modern, clean and towels changed every day.\\nBecause of hurricane Sandy the hotel issued us with a torch and glow sticks and offered us complimentary pay per view films/TV. We were expecting the power to fail, but fortunately the hotel was not affected (1 block away was in complete darkness)We were kept informed at all times by staff. When we were told our return flight was cancelled I contacted reception who extended our stay straight away and offered assistance contacting my airline. We met with other guests in the seating/library area of an evening, swapping stories over our glasses of complimentary wine (Ramone was the best 'host'). It is a nice touch that the hotel offers this between 6pm and 9pm each evening.\\nWe used the restaurant for breakfast as everywhere else was closed due to Sandy. The eggs, bacon and hash brown was very nice and staff very attentive.\\nThe Andaz 5th Ave is right in the middle of all the tourist areas, 5 mins in each direction to Grand Central Station, Time Square, Empire State Building and shopping on 5th Ave.\\nThis was our 2nd trip to New York, 1st time at Andaz. When we do return there is only one hotel we shall chose and that is Andaz 5th Avenue. The staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful, the hotel is modern with a warm atmosphere and in an excellent location.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I got a last minute room in the wake of Hurricane Sandy troubles, and would have been happy anywhere warm and with electricity. But this was a very cool corner of paradise. From the anti-hotel vibe in the lobby to the huge near floor to ceiling room windows overlooking the NY Public Library, the Andaz 5th oozes style in every corner. The hotel offers a great combination of elegant modern with a hint of classic. The cleanly designed room is minimalistic, yet warm with a odd-shaped, large couch perfect for gazing through the windows at the lights of the city skyscrapers. The bathroom is designed in wood and glass, with a huge shower (no bath) which includes a seat and foot bath in the back corner. I loved the pounded metal double sinks, very pretty. Another fun feature is that the room is operated entirely by touch, not traditional light switches. And, another nice touch when hotels often \"nickel and dime\" you for everything.. snacks and non-alcoholic room beverages are complimentary.. Add complimentary lobby coffee in the mornings and glasses of wine in the evenings.. and it all adds up to a fabulous stay. Great for business trips, couples, even families thanks to the large spacious feeling in the rooms. It\\'s also a great location from which to launch exploring Manhattan. Enjoy. I plan to do so myself again.',\n",

Highlights include the well-designed bathrooms and showers, the automated window shades and the free snacks and non-alcoholic minibar items. Friendly but low key, not 'in your face' service -- and I mean that in a good way. Also, Andaz has free in-room wi-fi, which is a must. I will definitely choose this place again, and in fact have a current reservation for later this year. \\nJust a few minor suggestions to get it from really good to perfect:\\n--the baggage holding area is out in the open in a corner of the library/lounge area. This is unsightly and also lacks proper security for peoples' belongings. \\n--the food at the restaurant is just OK. One dinner I had there was particularly substandard. However, in the hotel's defense, they offered to comp the meal without any unpleasantness whatsoever, which really mitigated the whole situation in my mind (although I didn't eat in the restaurant again during the trip).\\n--gym is sort of lacking ... there seems to be a lot of wasted space on the 2nd floor where they could put a better gym and spa, which would be more consistent with the price point and style of the hotel.\",\n",

The liquor store close by has an amazing selection of wines, plus lots of cold ones if you are in a hurry. The air con is noisy, we just simply switched it off which may not be an option in summer/winter. The lifts are slow at busy periods, some times I just walked the 11 floors (to keep fit!). The laundry on level 7 is an absolute winner if you are travelling on, as we were. If you are going to Newark airport, ask the concierge to book you the shuttle bus, it's far cheaper than the metered taxi.

       "  'text': 'Just got back from a 3 night stay at the Beacon. We wanted to stay in an area that had a more local neighbourhood feeling so we thought the Upper West Side would do the trick. I was really impressed by the value of this hotel. With the tax we paid $344 a night for a King room. Other hotels I researched were even more then that and the pictures didn’t seem as nice. We got there late at night and there was a big crowd in the lobby and low and behold Robin Williams was there visiting with fans. I assumed he was performing at the theatre next door but not sure. Seemed like a sign of a good visit. The room was very large. Much bigger then other New York hotels I’ve stayed in. As well the décor was really nice and bed very comfortable. It definitely seemed like they had renovated recently. Before our arrival I emailed to request a quiet room on a higher floor. They gave us a room on the top floor which is 25th. Our room was across from the elevators which I thought might be a problem for noise but we barely heard anything from the hallway. As well I had read reviews about the elevators being slow but we never had an issues with them. We had chatted with some local residences of the hotel that had been living there for 25 years. It was interesting to stay in a place with such history. When we woke up our first morning we were stunned at the view. A great way to start everyday. \\nThe subway is right around the corner which is really convenient. At the last minute I considered switching hotels to somewhere around Greenwich Village because I thought that we might be spending hours on the subway but the express train to Time Square is super fast. We would be downtown in around 15 minutes so getting around wasn’t a problem at all. \\nHaving the Viand Café downstairs is really convenient as well. We arrived late at night and it was so nice to pop down for a snack and drink. On our last day we had to leave for our flight early so again it was nice to have a reasonably priced meal downstairs. We also had breakfast at Le Pain Quotiden on 72nd which we really enjoyed as well we went to Sarabeth’s West which was good but nothing really special and pricey. We also partook in the famous Gray’s Papaya for a snack too. A really nice wine store is just downstairs too and a Duane Reade closeby if you forgot any toiletries. \\nThere’s lots of shopping around the area too which we didn’t expect which was great. A big DSW was just down the street. We rented bikes at Master Bike Shop on 72nd and did a nice ride around Central Park. \\nFor the beautiful room, view, location, and value I’d definitely recommend the Beacon.',\n",

There was no concierge, no afternoon cocktail hour, no morning coffer or tea bar in the lobby, or fresh fruit or spa water for the hotel guests. We had to ask for the liquid soap to be filled in the shower. For those of you who are un-\\nsettled by this sort of thing, the soap, shampoo, and hair conditioner containers in the shower are refilled between guests, not replaced. The shampoo dispenser in our shower had old dried shampoo remnants on the pump. The room was lovely. The view was the freeway and air conditioner units on other buildings. The bathroom was huge and nicely appointed. The front desk personnel were helpful but not knowledgable in the current happenings in Houston. Upon checkout, we were given driving instruction to the airport. One major problem: a marathon was in progress and literally all streets were closed to the highway. The Hotel Icon was nice but did not live up to expectations.\",\n",

She made all of the inconveniences of travel go away and had a very pleasant personality that was constantly focused on taking care of all of the hotel's guests. I was with a very large group and she was helpful to everyone in my group, as well as everyone else i saw her interact with while staying at the hotel. The bartender in the lobby bar was also fantastic and took care of a lot of people (and the associated chaos) easily. Overall, everyone I interacted with gave fantastic customer service and made staying at the Hotel Icon an enjoyable experience. I have stayed there before prior to Marriott buying it and was pleasantly surprised to see the same level of customer care demonstrated under the Marriott ownership.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I stayed at the the BW Downtown on two separate business trips in Nov. 2011. The access to downtown is perfect--a 10 minute walk to the office, although the shuttle is availble free of charge. The rooms are a bit larger than average, and the beds and bedding were very comfortable. One thing that struck me is that the place is very quiet--the hallways and stairs were recarpeted recently with heavy underlay and you don't notice people walking up and down the halls. There is a pool and hottub that I did not take advantage of. The complimentary breakfast every morning is great--eggs, bacon, sausage, yoghurt, toast, juice, coffee, etc. In the evening there are complimentary snacks and beverages as well. The high speed internet worked fine; much better than at larger places I've stayed at.\\nThere are many restaurants and pubs nearby and the Galleria is about a 20 min drive. River Oaks is quite close for shopping as well and the theatre district is very close. The Texas Art Supply is about 5 minutes away on Montrose, and on Westheimer about 10 min away there are a bunch of eclectic antique stores that are worth checking out on the weekend.\\nAccess to the airport is very good-- about a 30 minute drive on I-45 with no tolls.\\nI will definately stay here again. The staff are very friendly and they really do make sure that your stay is comfortable.\",\n",

The room is huge and has a mini kitchenette too. Super clean and comfortable. Parking is self park right next door with a discounted rate of $30 per night-even with our SUV! The gym is small but did the trick and there is a Starbucks less then a 5 minute walk away! The free continental breakfast is simple but did the trick. \\nThe staff was very friendly and helpful. We had brunch at Madison Restaurant after we arrived-a huge diner that was delicious and the wait staff very nice. We got cupcakes at Buttercup Bakery on the way back to the hotel. We saw Cirque du Soleil our first night and ordered a pizza and salad from Albitino's which is a 5 minute walk. Our last night there we ate at Chop A Steakhouse (a 10 minute walk) and took advantage of their Restaurant Week menu. A fabulous experience.\\nDuring check out the manager did a magic trick for my daughter! I have stayed at the Affinia chain and much prefer this hotel for traveling with teens/tweens. There is no restaurant or bar so if you're looking for the trendy/nightlife scene this is not for you. My husband and I have stayed at the W right around the corner and I would go there if you are looking for that vibe. But if you're looking for a spacious, clean, nice hotel that welcomes families, has cheap parking, free Wifi and free breakfast, you cannot beat the San Carlos!\",\n",

Breakfast, which was limited to bad bagels, toast, a couple of varieties of cereal and coffee was a chaotic mess. Tiny paper plates, cheap plastic knives that break, and tiny coffee cups that are too hot to carry was a horrible way to begin my day. Everything was disposable and unpleasant. Honestly, the airlines do better. I stayed there five days and not one morning could I easily grab a cup of coffee and take a seat. Just a mess. Don't even think about requesting a coffee service to be delivered to your room either. Other midtown hotels have self serve breakfast, and it works. The key is space, good variety, and enough staff to keep the place clean, well stocked, and to provide assistance. Actual glassware, plates, and utensils would be nice. This just is the worst.\\nThe San Carlos has the potential to be a good hotel. I wish I wanted to return. I wanted to like it very much. I just can not go back unless they care to provide a vastly better stay.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Our family stayed at the San Carlos for 7 days and found this hotel to be top notch in every way. The customer service from the bellman to the front desk to the maintenance and cleaning staff were all incredible! The rooms are spacious and very clean. Our rooms had refrigerators and microwaves and a small kitchen set up. Awesome Wolfgang Puck coffee too. Beds are extremely comfortable. Large screen TV in the bedroom and family room. The location was fabulous for walking to lots of the city sights. We felt very comfortable walking day and night and the staff greeted us with smiles whether it was 7am or 11pm. We were out shopping one day and were racing down the streets to get to the next store when a tall Irish man across the way was waving and smiling. It was the bellman on his day off, out and about, and in the crazy hustle and bustle of NY street walkers, he recognized us, waved to get our attention and sent a big smile asking if we were enjoying the city. Truly a gem! \\nRecommendations: Move one phone into the sitting area instead of having two phones in the bedroom. Perk up the breakfast selections. \\nWe can honestly say that this hotel is top notch on customer service and the rooms are great too. Highly recommend the San Carlos!',\n",

Warm welcome from Susu upon check-in in the impressive lobby area and she immediately wished my partner a happy birthday (the reason for our visit). We had a corner room on the 16th floor overlooking the Empire State Building so great views - and great sunrises each morning! The room was larger than we expected; huge comfortable bed with lovely linens, large bathroom with enormous and excellent shower, fluffy bathrobes (even a decent hairdryer in the bathroom which is a bonus). We were very happy with our 'home' for 3 nights. The location was also easy access to Penn St Station, Madison Square Gardens, Macy's etc - easy walking distance to most sights but not as noisy an area as Times Square, etc.\\nWe arrived pretty late on the first night so just went into the hotel bar for a quick drink and bar snack upon arrival. It has a nice ambience though the drinks were a little pricey (it is a hotel in Manhattan afterall!)\\nThe hotel also does some nice touches for guests - inclusive continental breakfast which was very good - fresh juices, tea & coffee, wide choice of fresh fruits, pastries, cereals, breads, cheese & meats. You can choose hot buffet items for an additionsl 12 dollars or choose from the menu. We found the continental breakfast was plenty for us and breakfast is served in a light & airy conservatory.\\nThey also provide free wine hour from 5pm-6pm, again very welcome after a long day sightseeing.\\nWhen you need to check in online for your flights home, you can go to the business centre and use their PC to check in and print out your boarding card for free. That was a great, hassle-free service that meant we weren't waiting on busy staff to help us do this.\\nWe signed up to the Kimpton InTouch membership before we visited - simply join online for free and you get perks such as free wifi and a voucher for free drinks from the minibar.\\nI think I've previously read complaints about maids walking into the room when guests are still in there but that didn't happen with us. There isn't a 'do not disturb' sign to hang on the outside of the door; it's a light switch change next to the door. If the room is empty then the light is orange; if you don't want to be disturbed then flick the switch and it changes to red, telling the maids not to enter. We weren't told about this but figured it out when seeing a neighbour's room light was a different colour!\\nOverall an excellent hotel with great rooms and friendly, professional staff. Would definitely stay again.\",\n",

Our last stay was at Sofitel, and I absolutely loved the service (held your bags, doorman became my friend, gorgeous suite)- Sofitel clearly understands five-star service. The Setai, in my standards, could not deliver when it came to friendly service and hospitality. The concierage did not go out of their way, and the doormen acted more like security guards. The only employee in Setai that actually knew the meaning of real quality five-star service was Brett. Thank you, Brett :) The rest should learn from him!\\nHere is a breakdown of the Positives and Negatives:\\n- gave us a room right away as soon as we landed, so easy early check in\\n- became obsessed with the espresso machine! But, housekeeper was so cheap on providing extra pods\\n- good location if you are into midtown/Times Square, personally, next time we want to be closer to Central Park \\n- Gym had good equipment, but dark paint on walls and no windows may be a hard environment for some to work out in, and what\\'s up with the old, bruised fruit?\\n- the room service was nice and quick (Sheniqua was a friendly voice on the other end)\\n- free shoe shine and ironing\\n- even though I was not happy with the hotel, the room itself was great. Our deluxe king room and bathroom was spacious and nice\\n- mini-fridge\\n- hotel car, if you can get it, is a maserati\\n- be careful, since the location is right on fifth ave, lower level room occupants might be able to hear the busy street, we were on floor 15, but I could still hear the hustle and bustle outside from the bathroom only not the room\\n******* Oh, the icing on the cake, the housekeeper threw away my take-out twice! The first time, grrr, I let it go, but then the next day, my Mario Batali pizza that was not even placed near a garbage was also \"cleaned up\". The manager was non-chalent and unapologetic. \\n*** I do not mind paying good money for good service, heck I stay at five-stars to receive it, but Setai was a huge disappointment. Not worth it! \\nTo end on a positive note, make sure you have drinks at the Manadarin one night to enjoy the million dollar view, I love u NYC!',\n",

       "  'text': \"My wife and I have tried numerous hotels in NYC without finding one we'd be interested in returning to. The Setai is the first one that hits on that metric.\\nFirst off, the location is convenient to both Penn and Grand Central Stations, being only a few blocks walk from each. Close to the E Subway (from JFK) as well. SO far, so good.\\nRoom was huge, and well stocked with water, sodas and Nespresso, all of which are included. It's not cheap by any means, but in NY nothing is, and the hotels we have tried in the $250-$350 range have generally been old, run down places with noisy (and largely non-functional) HVAC. The air system in the room at the Setai got a good amount of chill into the room, and did so quietly. Bravo!\\nTraffic noise was very muted, with is saying something for NY, the city that never sleeps and never stops blowing the horn on the taxi. The only noise issue was that the doors do not have any kind of damper on the closing/hinge, so if the guest doesn't bother to close the door gently, it slams. That was not an issue on Thursday or Friday of our stay, but Saturday apparently some of the guests on the floor partied late (3-4 am) and then came back too inebriated to bother keeping the noise level down. That interrupted sleep numerous times because of the banging of the doors. Management please take note. Put door closers on the guest rooms, so that the door will close gently and quietly.\\nFood was expensive but good. Fortunately, my wife is a member of the Leading Hotels program, so we got a $70 breakfast credit daily. That sounds like a lot, but it is about what breakfast for two costs. Service was excellent at times and a bit less so at other times, but no major issues.\\nAll things considered, we enjoyed the Setai very much and will be back.\",\n",

I was very happy with the room and would even say it may be the best suite yet in NYC beyond the plaza. So why only 4 stars? Their room service menu makes no sense in terms of price. $40 for a Belgium waffle with a choice of hot drink and a main entree (meat) is under $40.

Met by Ms. Cornelia Samara, the GM, upon arrival. Made us feel at home. A few goodies for the kids left in the room. A nice touch. We stayed in the suite. Good sized rooms for NYC. Lovely terrace with excellent views. Breakfast at the shop was great. The lemon soufflé pancake is a must. The eggs benedict too. Homey feel. Thank you to the general manager and team.

Snacks and soft drinks free, nice touch, great space, free wifi, but the huge TV's had a non-inituitive interface, which was annoying and hard to work. The bar is downstairs and is a brave attempt to blend the chefs with the customers, with completely open cooking stations, we didn't try it as it was standing room only and we were knackered. Benjamin's down the road was great though. We'd definitely go back, as it is perfectly sited for 5th Avenue, Bryant Park, the Theater district and only a mile and a bit to Central Park.

       "  'text': \"I chose this hotel because it is the closest hotel to my old apartment. I moved out of NY a year ago, and miss it terribly. I wanted to be right back where I used to live. I was a little hesitant about the Beacon, because I had been in there years ago. And I mean over 20 years ago, and it wasn't very nice. But it has REALLY changed!!! It's VERY nice!!! Let me break it down from the big picture to the small details.\\nLocation: Perfect for me. I love the Upper West Side. I spend most of my time in Central Park (walking, photographing, running, bird watching, people watching, going to the zoo, bike riding, exploring, etc). My goal when I lived in NY was to live as close to Fairway (a unique grocery store) as humanly possible. The Beacon is right across the street. And the Beacon has kitchens in each room, so I actually did buy food at Fairway and prepared it in my room. But back to the location description. 75th and Broadway is the epicenter of 3 amazing cupcake shops, a famous bakery, Fairway, Zabars, Juice Generation (great smoohties), Harry's Burritos, Big Nicks, Shake Shack, the Park, three excellent gyms and a couple great yoga places. If your vacation plans don't revolve around food and exercise, you'll think that list was strange. But for me, it was perfect. It was like being home. I should also mention Lincoln Center and the Natural History museum are very close by. All the museums on the East Side are walkable through the park. If you're more into the downtown scene/night life or Broadway, maybe it's not for you. But hey, the subway is RIGHT THERE, so transportation is convenient.\\nHotel: The lobby, staff, elevators were all superior for a non-brand hotel.\\nHallways: Carpeted, fairly quiet, wide and clean.\\nRooms. Bright, clean, newly remodeled, spacious, welcoming, pleasing finishes, comfortable. Each room (as far as I know) has a kitchen (with dishes/pots and pans),a safe, tv, free wifi, extra blankets, good toiletries, ironing board, luggage rack, comfortable beds and pillows. Our room was amazing. It was room 2112, on the 21st floor. It was a corner room with a view I could NOT keep my eyes off of. One window faced Central Park and the East side. One faced downtown. We had views of Times Square, The Chrysler Building, Broadway (the street) and the Ansonia-which is a gorgeous building, and on the East, views of some of my very favorite architecture (the San Remo!), Citicorp, the Sherry Netherland and that glorious Park. We slept with the blinds open. We watched the sun rise over the buildings, We couldn't stop looking or taking pictures. I had lived in NY 10 years, in many apartments, and I never had a view like that. \\nBTW there were also windows in the kitchen and Bathroom.The one in the bathroom opened.\\nI will ALWAYS stay at this hotel when I'm in NY. I think, over the years, I've stayed in almost every hotel that city has to offer, including the Plaza and the Waldorf, and this was by far, my favorite.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Granted, the luxury hotel market in Houston is somewhat limited, but I was pretty disappointed in the Four Seasons. The valet staff were very prompt and friendly, so I do want to give special thanks to them because they made a wonderful first impression. \\nThe lobby is nice. There is something very retro about the chandeliers, but it somehow works. Overall, I would say the lobby is quite impressive and in line with the purported star rating of the hotel. The exterior, however, is very very 70\\'s. There is absolutely nothing they can do about that, but you cannot help but notice it.\\nThe desk clerk was quite pleasant. I cannot remember her name, but as with most people at the hotel, if you were interacting with them in person, they delivered top-notch service. My biggest complaint about the service, and it is a big one, is that they NEVER answer the phone promptly. I literally would let the phone ring 30+ times, still with no answer. So then I would try housekeeping, the concierge, room service, anybody...same thing. For a five-star hotel, it is pretty unacceptable for this to occur. One time - sure; things happen. This problem, however, existed throughout my entire stay. \\nAs others have noted, there are certain elements that make the hotel appear quite dated. The elevators are ancient and should definitely be at the top of the list for upcoming renovations. The tracks on the drapes in the room were also quite old. The rooms were pleasant, but not extraordinary. I had to switch rooms, however, because the first one had a very awful musty smell. We were then moved to a room on the level with the pool. It was okay, but it felt very dark. Also, the pool area looked a bit worse for wear. I can imagine how luxurious this place must have been in its prime, but that prime has certainly passed. \\nOne thing that I find absolutely unforgiveable about this hotel, though, is the ice machine room. They need to remove all signage relating to the ice machine and make guests call to have ice delivered. I had the misfortune of going to fetch my own ice, and I walked into a room that was filthy, covered in trash and clearly (hopefully) not meant to be seen by guests. I was so shocked. For any hotel above 1 star, I would expect more.\\nThe location is great, and you are able to get out of the city quickly, but I was surprised at how dead Houston is at night. Clearly, this has nothing to do with the hotel, so I am not trying to make any connection there; I was just surprised. I would think it might be wiser to stay near the Galleria if you are looking for something other than just a business stay.\\nAll in all, the stay was \"ok\"; nothing really wow\\'ed me about this place, so I guess that disappoints me, but I tend to find that to be the case with Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton properties. They rely a lot on name recognition and branding, but they always seem to fall flat for me, both in terms of service and design/aesthetics.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Stayed here for the first time as hotels I usually use in NYC were all full. Thoughts :\\n-great location. On W44th between 5th and 6th, a couple of blocks from Grand Central Station and a few mins walk from Times Square, but W44th is not the noisiest street so good from that perspective\\n-boutique feel. It's small in NYC hotel terms, and perhaps lacks some of the facilities as a result, but is also friendlier than many. Staff are great.\\n-the room I had was inward facing and had no view at all (a wall obscured part of the window - could not even tell what the weather was like - seriously). However, this also meant the room was quiet - not always the case in NYC\\n-room was pretty small. Was fine for me travelling solo but would've been cramped if shared. I don't know if this was typical of rooms in the hotel but I suspect it was\\n-room was otherwise v nice. Quality fittings, nice linen, new-looking bathroom with good shower and Molton Brown toiletries, with a small desk and HD TV and a mini bar in the room\\n-wifi is free in this hotel which isn't all that common in NYC - could save you $20/day\\n-room service menu is very limited, although food (from Triomphe, the French Restaurant at Ground Level) is of good quality and the service was quick when I ordered. First room service menu I've seen that had no club sandwich and no fries !\\n-the hotel has a tiny gym and sauna. The gym, although v small, has enough kit in decent condition for a sensible workout and it was unusual to see anyone else in there\\n-I didn't visit the bar but it looked lively and has a good reputation for cocktails and atmosphere\\n-free coffee in the lobby\\nPerfectly nice place to stay for a few days on business and very conveniently located, but room size, gym size and limitations of room service menu means I'll probably revert to my preferred hotel next time, although I wouldn't mind staying here again. Rates are comparable.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Just finished a long weekend stay at the Andaz. Prefer to stay at Hyatts for reward status, and now have stayed in all Of the Hyatts in Manhattan. Observations:\\n1) Check-in was a mess. The Andaz philosophy of iPads around a central desk area without a formal checkin desk can be hectic when busy, but there wasn't any line. Stood for a minute with no assistance, eventually an associate looked up from computer screen to see us, but then helped a guest who had a question, who showed up at desk after we arrived. Associate who checked us in informed us our room wasn't ready, acknowledged our Gold Passport status, took our cell phone #, took our bags. Was told at checkin something about 'I'm checking to see what the best room we have available is', and then told quickly before whisking our bags away that 'we have a King room available for you'- same category booked. If no upgrades available, I understand, but don't treat the category booked as a favor. \\n2) No perfect location in Manhattan as you may prefer both uptown and downtown locations, but hotel is almost in perfect spot. Easy access to Grand Central and 4/5/6 line uptown or downtown, easy walking distance to all midtown locations. Difficult to get a taxi during weekday business hours, there is no dedicated cab stand for hotel. Saw our associate outside the hotel when returning from unsuccessfully trying to hail a cab on 5th Ave, he offered to wait on 5th to hail a taxi, we laughed and said that wouldn't be necessary.\\n3) Received ph call that room was ready about 10min after checkin. Room was right across elevator-- normally not a fan of this at all but hotel was very quiet during stay, no noise issues. \\n4) Room is spartan, no wall ornaments/pictures but I don't mind this, not staying for artwork. Large desk with plenty of outlets, one large outside window with automated blind coverage, large cream couch for lounging/clothes, comfy bed. Plenty of room for luggage.\\n5) Fridge well stocked, I suspect most adults won't drink the fruit soda, there is room in the fridge for your own beverages if you move things around/out. The food is a bag of pretty good potato chips, two ok chocolate squares, and an incredibly salty granola bar.\\n6) TV has a lot of interactive/smart features but only a smattering of HD channels, not an issue for me but if you are watching a lot of TV in your room it is a bit puzzling.\\n7) Bathroom is poorly designed. Two sinks, plenty of space, but two extremely bad design choices. First, no door separating toilet from rest of bathroom. I am not a fan of modern/Mandarin Oriental-like open or exposed bathroom spaces, and not having a separate WC is really not negotiable, esp for those guests sharing a room who aren't involved. Second, the shower stall is really poorly designed. The glass partition, like in lots of European hotels, doesn't extend far enough to stop splashing into the rest of the bathroom. The shower is a rainshower head with high ceilings, I'm not that tall or large but there is no way to stop water from splashing over and on to the small ledge separating the stall from the rest of the bathroom floor, you have to wipe the ledge mult times during the shower to control the water from spreading. In addition the corner between the glass partition and the back wall of the shower has at least a 1/3 inch gap between them, so water splashes through that gap and in the corner behind the sinks. More wiping down, and that area has already started to have discoloration and wear of the tile and grout. It's inconvenient, and adds to maintenance costs, and will eventually require renovation before it was necessary. Hyatt must spend millions on new room prototypes- I don't understand how this wasn't recognized as a problem. The Andaz Wall Street has similar shower sizes but not the same problems.\\n8) Good coffee service in the lobby. Some fruit in baskets but no other snackies. Good selection of papers.\\n9) Didn't go to gym or spa. No room service ordered.\\n10) Went to restaurant for Sunday breakfast. Priced similarly to other hotel restaurants. Crowded, had a wait for a table. Breakfast was excellent, recommend the mini brats.\\nProb the first choice for Hyatts in Manhattan because of location. I think the Andaz Wall Street has nicer rooms, service, restaurant, 48 Lex comparable in quality for usually less money. Will see what the anticipated Park Hyatt brings. Overall would stay again.\\nContact me for any questions. Happy travels!\",\n",

       "  'text': \"We were at the Hilton Americas of Houston from 10.28.2012 through 11.5.2012. It has a Cafe. I had been at this same hotel last year and frankly, the service was terrible. I and my friend waited 20 minutes for a waiter to come around..completely mind blowing. Especially for a Hilton. This year, I'm pleasantly surprised. The crew of the Cafe, beginning with Juan A. Gererro, Cafe supervisor, Yulia Putnam, Beverage and Food, from St. Petersburg, Russia and our incredible waiter, Yorbel, from Kazakhstan, turned this situation around. What a lovely shock! I love Hilton's because they truly are a UN, bringing people from all parts of the world together. Yorbel was a treasure. He is intelligent, personable, a really good hearted person. Yorbel is in his\\n3rd year of accounting at the University here in Houston. Further, he's already passed his first CPA of three. He's one of those people who is going to go FAR in life, be very successful. He's a waiter at the Cafe and what ashamed...his talents are so much more. I hope Hilton will consider him for a position in Accounting and utilize all of him, instead of a tiny part of him. Needless to say, we came back for lunch nearly every day and were given swift, prompt service with a genuine and sincere smile. Honestly, it felt like a family was welcoming us. And that's why I'm taking the time to put this on TripAdvisor. It was an incredible experience. Beyond the norm. The Hilton management has really chosen fine people in a service industry that sometimes falls very short. The food quality was never a question. It is excellent, served hot and is creative. Our favorites were the Tortilla soup, the crab cakes and the quesadilla. Dinners were always hot and delicious. My particular favorite was a caesar salad with slices of flatiron steak on it. We had room service, which has always been speedy--20 minutes after the phone call. The food arrived hot. I'll be coming back to the Hilton Americas next fall for the IQA, international Quilt Association, show. And I'm really looking forward to eating in the Cafe again, instead of dreading it as I did in 2011. Thank you, Juan, Julia and Yorbel. You all rock! :-)\",\n",

The rest of the staff, including the executive chef, worked very hard to make the situation better, so that took some of the sting out of the manager's response. Overall, good experience.

The building has that solid and well-constructed feel of older buildings, with beautiful moldings and arched doorways. The service was the best I've had in a hotel in a while.

When we woke up the first morning, it was fantastic to open the blinds to see New York city in all its urban glory. It was really exciting and we could not wait to get going. As soon as you step out, you are right in the centre of everything you came to New York for.\\nWe understand the beds are new since a year and we slept like babies which was fantastic because we suffered no jet lag (from UK) and I was found I was sleeping for 10 hours! (unheard of). Not only are the windows sound proofed but the hotel is in a quiet zone where traffic must resist honking and beeping at certain times of the night. For the 4 nights we were guests, we did not hear a single sound from the corridors either last thing at night or early morning which is highly unusual. Probably the best sleep I have had overseas.\\nWe had a kitchenette which is ok - one can knock up a bit of breakfast but nothing too complicated. There is no worktop space and about 3 cooking utensils with enough cutlery for 2 people. The fridge is great for fruit, eggs and juice. A coffee machine is provided and a kettle.\\nEverything worked like clockwork. The only comment would be that I missed having a bar, a communal area to fall into after a long day's walking the great streets and sights of Manhatten. Loved to have come back for a cocktail and communal chat with other residents, etc. \\nThe hotel is billed as a 3 star but we can categorically say the bedrooms are 4 star. We understand a bar is being added from Feb 13 and I hope this does not mean they gain a 4th star allowing the rates to increase. Its not cheap for a 3 star but NY is not cheap. Its a great hotel and good value as it stands.\",\n",

The location is second to none, the service is superior and the various rooms in which I have stayed are always a joy to come back to in the evenings. My most recent room had a full kitchen so leaving in the morning was often delayed by the enjoyment of a coffee and bagle breakfast overlooking the City.

We had a few problems booking the room (we were transferred to the wrong extension twice) but it was worth it. Upon arrival Valeria was efficient and helpful. She gave us a fantastic upgrade which was far away from the convention that was going on. The view of the Houston Galleria area at night and the sun rising in the morning was great. The infinity pool on the 18th floor was nice but we didn't try it out due to the rainy weather and LOTS of people. The view is very nice! The pool is heated so it could be used most of the year. The section of the 18th floor where the pool is located is covered but open on the sides to the elements. The 24 Grille, located in the lobby is a little expensive but comparable to other hotels. I recommend the Orange Blueberry Pancakes for breakfast. Yum! This Westin provides a free shuttle to nearby businesses and restaurants. They do charge for parking so the free shuttle is the way to go. CityCentre is about 15 minutes away and a great place to meet friends, shop and eat out. BUT Memorial City Mall is within walking distance, just across the street from the hotel. They are connected by a 3rd floor sky walk. The only problem we experienced was the hotel is next to a hospital so there are sirens at various times. It didn't bother me (sound sleeper), but my husband heard them during the night.\",\n",

There is enough space to get around and feel comfortable for a stay. The beds are a bit firm, but I donot mind so much. The bathrooms are clean and bright, however, a bit tight. WiFi was free and worked well. It seems the common areas of the hotel are still under some sort of renovation.\\nI would recommend eating someplace other than the hotel restaraunt. We waited 45 minutes for hamburgers and pasta. The explanation was the burgers are made fresh and take time. This is un-acceptable, as we noticed a few others come in, order, served, and left. The manager took care of this issue, as we were clearly un-happy with this. The following morning's breakfast was very week....at best. I advise finding another eating establishment (there is a food court accross the street) if staying at this hotel.\\nAgain, I must state this is a training hotel, with students working the hotel and restaraunt. The service is spotty, depending on the students working. However, the students need the experience on the do's and donot's of hospitality industry.\",\n",

I'll start with the good feedback: The rooms are nice, they have great lounge chairs to relax in and the bathrooms have a great amount of counterspace. The beds are comfortable (as most Hiltons are) and there is plenty of closet and drawer space. \\nNow for the rest...When I walked into my room, it had such a strong odor of paint, there was no hot water..for all 5 days I was there! I would crank the heat up in my room in the morning so the cold shower would actually feel good. The internet connectivity was terrible. It was hit or miss all the time. When I arrived in my room, there was no room service menu, no directory, no bottled water. The light in the closet wouldn't go off when you closed the door, so I had to disconnect it so I could sleep at night. Only one elevator was working, so it took forever to get up to your room or back to the lobby. The bathroom mirrors in the conference space are enough to make you dizzy. I'm not sure who ever thought their design was a good idea, but it's like being in a clown house. And the main restaurant in the hotel was still closed.\\nI'm sure once they work out all their kinks and get everything fixed and opened, it will be a nice hotel, but I'm not prepared to take a second chance on it. They should have waited another month or so before opening back up to the public...big mistake.\",\n",

All sorts of dining options (Ruggles for delicious salads and healthy food!) and some unique shops. \\nThe only slight difficulty is the parking garage which, although it gets good marks for being attached to the hotel, is always jammed with cars. So I valet parked, which isn\\'t cheap, but oh well. \\nI will definitely stay at the Hotel Sorella again. I loved it, and I\\'m hard to impress when it comes to hotels.',\n",

Prices were jacked up by $50 a night after the storm (supposedly because of the Marathon). The TV system throughout the hotel was brushed off and our problems were only addressed when we pointed out that we were not 1 or two night guests but in fact there for weeks. I understand this will be completely fixed mid November.\\nI agree with all the positive comments most reviewers have made, this is why we had chosen the Beacon as a return visit.

The hotel is well positioned within a short walk of the 72nd St Subway station so it's very good base for getting about. We can recommend buying a 7 day metro card, we certainly got our monies worth and it saves the hassle of buying tickets. The hotel has helpful & friendly staff, the concierge is particularly knowledgeable. We had a very comfortable and spacious room on the 25th floor, with a small kitchenette, fridge etc useful for preparing breakfast. There is no restaurant or bar at this hotel but there are plenty of both within a short walking distance. We can recommend Viand next door to the hotel for breakfast and 'Citrus', an excellent Thai restaurant just round the corner (great sushi). There is a huge Fairway supermarket across the road and an amazing (if expensive) delicatessan next door to that. Central Park is 2 blocks away, it takes about 20 minutes walking briskly. All in all The Hotel Beacon is a lovely & welcoming place to come back to after a day of heavy sightseeing and we will definitely rebook if we ever go back to New York.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'The pluses:\\nThe bed was big and comfortable, with nice pillows. The rooms have\\ngood high ceilings and lots of storage space. The location is very\\ncentral - although would not be first choice if you want the more stylish parts of town. There are lots of complementary snacks and drinks, both in\\nthe room and the lobby. The bathroom (actually a shower room) was very\\nstylish. The staff were very enthusiastic and friendly. \\nThe minuses:\\nLots of the design involved style over substance. The overall room\\nspace was large but was divided up in a way that left a 2 foot gap\\nbetween the bed and the wall/ television. The safe was behind a pull\\ndown shelf that then projected out requiring the arms of a large\\nprimate to reach the back of the safe itself. There was a kitchenette\\nbut only one glass (in a room for up to four people). The cutlery was\\nin a drawer with a flat front. It did not open with a spring\\naction,you had to coax it open squeezing your fingers between the\\nbottom edge and the dishwasher (yes) door below. There were the usual\\nsigns about hanging up your towels. The double sink had one small\\ntowel rail on one side and nothing on the other. There were two more\\nhooks for towels which left none for the bathrobes. One of the room\\ndivider doors did not close properly and the doors to the bathroom\\nclosed with enormous creaking and banging sounds however carefully you\\ntried.\\nOverall we wished we had not chosen to pay for this much space when\\nlots of it was badly used. \\nWhen we left we were told that they could not get any taxis and were offered a town car to Penn station for $35. We took that and later got billed for about $140 dollars. It was refunded after an email and phone call but the email confirming it was being refunded apologised for the delay in replying but not for overcharging us in the first place. Not the best customer service.',\n",

Also, the air in the room was amazing, but I could not have the air conditioning/heat on at night because something in the unit was rattling. So could not use as white noise. \\nWe purchased room via Snique Away and I bought the 12th floor deluxe view room. We made one special request and that was that we only had one night in NYC and it was my daughters first time, so said we'd love the Empire State building view BUT I am also very sensitive to sound (thus the view room purchase) and specifically requested not to be next to elevator and clearly stated that our sound avoidance needs trumped desire for view. So despite this request, we ere put in a room directly in front of the elevators, not backed up to them, so I thought maybe it would be OK and didn't request to be changed. As it turns out, the elevators were not the problem; we were also next to some shaft and in the middle of the night there was this awful banging sound that went on and on. I don't know if it was pipes or something else changing temperature, but it woke me up and kept me up for quite some time. We were on the 23rd floor and directly across from the elevator, 2305 I believe. If you want a quiet room, I would ask to avoid being next to any shafts, elevator or otherwise.\",\n",

The room was big enough to accomodate four of us while kids slept in the sofa bed. The room was clean and we were satisfied by the housekeeping. \\nThe continental breakfast (very basic though) and the wi-fi in the room is included in the price. The reception staff was also very helpful. I think considering all above, the price-quailty balance of this hotel is excellent.

       "  'text': \"For those less familiar with Manhattan, the lodging options are overwhelming. With so many choices, it should be easy to find a myriad of properties that suit any number of requirements. But for me, it was a struggle to find the perfect location, level of amenities, and acceptable price point for a recent 4-day trip w/ my hubby.\\xa0\\nI ruled out the overpriced hipster boutiques, the stuffy landmarks, the dinosaur properties, the tourist-laden chains, and the too-good-to-be true rates in less desirable parts of town. After that, I wasn't left with nearly as many options as you'd think.\\nThen I found the listing for the San Carlos. I loved that they're one of the very last independently owned hotels in NYC, catered to a European clientele (which usually means non-fussy rooms, immaculately clean spaces, and competent staff), and the Manhattan East location; the area was convenient to RCMH where we were seeing 2 nights of concerts. The fact the rooms looked large vs the price and came w/ mini fridges and microwaves (somewhat unusual for Manhattan) sealed the deal. But looking good on paper doesn't mean in reality it will pan out.\\nI'd made my reservation months in advance, over the phone, for a certain room type that the young lady I spoke to had 100% guaranteed. When I called week-of to confirm my reservation, I was told there was a possibility I might not be able to get the room type I'd been promised. Irked, I referenced the original reservation but they explained sometimes these things happen. True, but I hung up the phone and considered rebooking elsewhere; the phone rang back moments later and the young lady I originally spoke to apologized, said they would upgrade me at no fee and get me what I needed no matter what, and really acted as if she valued my business. I'd expect this from a 5 star property, but at a under $300 a night spot, it was refreshing. Customer service is a dying art. The staff at the San Carlos is old school, in the best possible, most refreshing way.\\xa0\\nUpon arrival, an easy cab ride from Penn Station, the lobby was sparkling, the bellman exceptional, and the check-in flawless. It's not the fanciest place, more suited for the upscale business traveler (though I spied many families too) but the cleanliness, a huge factor for me, absolutely perfect. And my room, a King, was HUGE. Not huge just by NYC standards, huge by any hotel standard.\\xa0\\nThe view from our particular room wasn't much to see, but windows that actually open in both the room and bathroom were a bonus. The amenities were lovely, towels and robe divinely soft, the bed linens super comfy, and a pant press a blast from the past. The room was modern, simple, understated, private, quiet, and cozy. Everything worked too. Which should go without saying but unfortunately is often not the case in any class of hotel. The real silverware, plates, and glasses provided were a great compliment to the microwave and fridge.\\n\\xa0Did I mention that housekeeping is outstanding? In my years of travel, I've never seen more competent housecleaning.\\xa0\\nMy interaction with the staff was easy peasy. Items I needed were sent up immediately, dinner spots/phone numbers provided, and I was always greeted with a smile. I dreaded check out because it meant our experience was over. I literally had zero complaints during my entire stay except that the Indian restaurant next door (that serves as the San Carlos' complimentary breakfast serving area and then offers their own menu for limited room service too), is simply not up to par with the rest of the hotel. \\xa0If 24 hour American cuisine room service is a make it or break it deal for you, that's about the only reason I'd consider finding a different hotel. Seeing as Manhattan has every food conceivable, most of it deliverable, I easily overlook this.\\nQuiet rooms, pleasant interiors/halls, a great business center/overflow lobby, elevators that were kept constantly cleaned (check the Ritz for smudges, lol), and staff that valued my business means that next I'm in NYC I'm making a beeline right back here. Sure, there's more glamorous or hip spots, but for the level of service vs price and comfort, there's a reason this is a hidden gem amongst your hundreds of NYC hotels. Part of me doesn't want the secret to get out.\",\n",

Check in was fine and my bags were delivered quickly to my room and I was shown how to work all the various things in the room. Complimentary drinks in the fridge is a real bonus. However this was about the only time any of the staff actually spoke to me. Each time I got the lift up of down I was greeted with hello or good morning but try to engage the attendant in conversation and it is an up hill battle. I thought maybe it was an isolated case but it happened with all of the attendants. I did come down in the lift once with one of the residents and the attendant didn't draw breath so I assume that hotel guests are just to be tolerated to defray the cost of maintenance on the building.\\nSame with the staff at reception and the door man, each time I walked passed I was ignored. I just put it down to the fact that I was just not Upper East Side enough and fankly having said all this it didn't really bother me.\\nThe rooms are large and beds comfy. As far as amenities I could not complain. Bathroom was a bit tired and needed little things fixed and an upgrade. Location is also great with everything nearby.\\nI can tick it off my list but I wouldn't stay there again.\",\n",

Complimentary refreshments in room, which is a nice touch of the hotel.\\nBad points – 1. The housekeeping staff took away one of my tops by mistake. People make mistakes sometimes so I was not too upset that it happened. I was unhappy as I had to explain the incident to the reception 3 times before someone actually acted upon it – very disappointing given it is supposed to be a 5-star hotel. The receptionist told me that housekeeping could not find the top but then it was later returned to my room with no note of apologies or explanation; 2. Hotel staff in general was polite and professional but some of them (esp. lift attendants) were too stiff – you just couldn’t have a chit chat with them – not very friendly; 3. There was some cigarette smell lingering for a couple of days. When we rang the reception, they said it was the smell of the cleaning liquid. (really? Seriously? Are you kidding me?!!); 4. Bathroom is bit old and dated. Took 10mins before hot water would come thru every evening.\\nThe hotel staff recommended a diner called Gene’s on the 60th – absolute gem – must try. The hotel also offered 15% off if dine in “Bottega del Vino” next door. Please I beg you not to bother – the food was ok but all the waiters were so up themselves and arrogant and rude, which made the whole dining experience pretty awful. \\nMost of the guests at the hotel seemed rather miserable and took themselves too seriously, maybe this is why staff were not very laid back.

The restaurants leave a lot to be desired if you are a vegetarian. Neither option is particularly noteworthy. I recommend heading across the way to The Grove.\\nTheir SPA ought to have its own page.

The few times I decided to walk to the downtown, a 15-minutes walk took me to the heart of it. If you aren\\'t a walkiing person, the shuttle of the hotel will take you anywhere within the downtown area or even to the midtown if the distance isn\\'t too far. \\nThe rooms are clean, spacious and very well equipped with an iron, a coffee maker, the basic bathroom amenities, satellital TV and as many bottles of water as you can drink. It also has a microwave and a small fridge, which makes your stay even more comfortable. Vending machines are avaiable to get microwave food and sodas whenever you want.\\nThe best of the hotel is the staff: Jo, the front-desk lady is just lovely and helpful. Sonny (the multi-task guy of the business) is always ready to give you a ride on the shuttle or to recommend you the hot spots to hang out at night. There is a third front-desk guy called Don, that kindly took us to a Walgreen\\'s like 20 blocks away from the hotel in his own car, as the shuttle only works from Monday to Friday. That was something nice I didn\\'t expect.\\nThe breakfast is simple but effective: waffles, sweet bread, cereal, milk, coffee, eggs, sausages and bacon. They serve the same breakfast everyday, so try to \"rotate\" your choices if you are staying more than one night and you don\\'t like to have the same everyday.\\nThe hotel is totally non-smoking. If you are a nicotine addict, DON\\'T DO IT INSIDE the rooms. During our stay, we saw two guys being kindly kicked out of the hotel after paying a $ 250.00 fine for smoking inside.\\nThe only thing I didn\\'t like were the pillows. They were too large and squishy and it\\'s the only kind of pillows they have, so if you are a \"firm\" pillows user like me, you will have to bring yours. \\nIn conclusion, if I ever visit Houston again, I will stay here for sure.',\n",

I really can't complain about anything other than my wife lamenting that she wasn't there to enjoy the comfortable bed that the Westin is well known for. If you have time, there is a large mall across the street with a sky bridge connecting to the hotel. Last note: If you are taking a cab from the airport, bring lots of cash; it was over $80 with tip.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'My wife and I stayed at your hotel a bit over a week ago. Overall, it was an ok experience but could have been better. The room was fantastic and the gentleman at the front desk put us in just the room we requested. Our only problem was the horrible room service experience on the day of our departure. They messed up our order not just once, but twice and it was still not correct! We had ordered two steaks-medium rare with broccoli and a toffee cake dessert with ice cream. The 1st time they forgot the broccoli, cooked our steakes well, and brought us up a plate of toffee cake with the ice cream completely melted! Shame to even try serving a guest a dessert that looked like that! The server apologized and said the kitchen was too hot, but that is no excuse! The second time it took over an hour to get our meal. This time they seperated the ice cream and cake which was great, remembered the broccoli, but our steaks were still well! By then we were so hungry and had no time (or nerve) to request a re-make. The kitchen took care of our meal but we were still highly dissatisfied. We complained to the front office manager, Mrs. Heinrichs, who was very nice and did say they were short staffed (one person was shuttling and delivering room service simultaneously?) but they should have gotten another attendant or someone from the restaurant to help. I understand one mistake, but the same one twice is unacceptable.\\nWe do plan to return again as we found the hotel atmosphere so great, but hopefully our next visit will have a much more positive in room dining experience.',\n",

I tried to adjust the thermastat but to no avail. The other issue is the need for a token to exit the parking lot. This meant you were constantly asking the front desk for them.

I didn\\'t care too much for the \"disinfectant\" smell in the room, but the comfy king sized bed made this forgivable. The red-colored gym on the first floor is about as unique as I\\'ve ever seen. If anything needed improvement, I\\'d have to say that I\\'d rather wished the desk staff and door staff were a little more crisp and professional. As it stood, the front of the hotel had too many bellhops not only idling but not having much of a clue of the surrounding areas when asked about whether \"X\" place was within walking distance. The desk staff may have simply been a little too informal for my taste, but it could be more a folksy, laid back Southern way of talking to guests than I am used to.

And I would have to say that Four Seasons Houston really delivered.\\nService; Everyone, and I mean everyone, from the doormen/woman, the reception, concierge, the barstaff, housekeeping and roomservice, to the Manager is dedicated to make your experience the best. They smile, they greet you, by name very often! They resolve any issues that you may have, solve any problems that may occcur. Just ask! And thats my best tip overall: Dont burn inside with any problems or wishes, express them and you will see that they will go the extra mile to help you.\\nLocation: The hotel is situated perfectly downtown. The hotel car will bring you around downtown, the taxies que up just outside, So your never short of transportation,. ( The citys light-rail-metro runs very close also)\\nRooms: I had a executive suite which did not stand back to other suites Ive stayed in. I really cant see the need for major rehabilitations that other reviewers have screamed about. The hotel is distingueshed and classic all the way.\\nFood: The breakfast is good, although pricey. The Sunday Brunch is worth a stay for itself. The dinners in Quattro is close to Michelin-quality.\\nTake my word for it: As a business traveller youre going to love it here.',\n",

       "  'text': \"This review just echos what everyone else has said. This hotel is perfect if you are are going on holidays to Manhattan with a family.\\nWe were on a family trip of a lifetime to New York for a few days and this hotel made it the perfect holiday. Our room was on the 7th floor and there was buckets of space. The bedroom had two double beds and the sitting room was large with sofa, armchair and dining room table for 4. The kitchen had a normal (by Irish standards) sized fridge and cooker plus a microwave. It was just an alcove really but perfectly adequate for preparing / heating up the goodies from Fairways.\\nThere was a laundry across the hall from us which also had two payphones - so we could use prepaid phone cards to call home very cheaply. Tea and coffee were provided. The coffee perculator was intuitive to use and made exceptionally nice coffee.\\nFairways supermarket is directly across the road. It is not for the faint hearted as it is a warren, and very busy. At the meat and deli counters you need to take a ticket and wait for your number to be roared out (took me a while to figure this out!)That said, it is a tourist attraction in its own right for those more used to pushing a trolly around Tescos or Lidl. Just don't take kids when you are doing that first supplies shop especially if they are just off the plane and tired. We remained pretty much on Irish time while in New York as it was only for a few days so meals from Fairways at the dining table in our room was ideal rather than restaurants with children.\\nThe subway is left out of the hotel and two minute walk. There is a self service machine on the way in. We put $20 on a metrocard which allowed the four of us to be swiped through one after the other. You can see your balance at the turnstyle as you swipe. Just be sure you know your uptown from your downtown before you travel. The subway stops at convenient points for all tourist attractions.\\nCentral Park is two blocks away and a haven to come back to in the afternoon after sighseeing. The staff were helpful and given that we left on the eve of Superstorm Sandy they were serene in the face of mounting panic from potentially stranded tourists. \\nThis hotel was available as part of Tesco clubcard deals via Tour America which saved considerably on the cost of the holiday.\",\n",

First the good part-/rooms are unbelievably large with beautiful baths. Unfortunately they are devoid of any warmth. And speaking of warmth, I had to call my \"personal assistant\" for several blankets because my room was so very cold. With the temperature set way above \\n70, I could not get the room over 68. Why would a hotel of this caliber not have a true concierge staff headed up by a member of the clefs d\\'or? I called prior to arrival to ask about theatre tickets and the personal assistant had no idea what show (on Broadway) that I was speaking about. First thing she asked me was had I gone online to Telecharge to look for tickets. Huh? During my first day at the hotel I again called my assistant for dinner reservations within the hotel. This time I was told to call the restaurant directly. I guess I am unclear as to what the staff is there for. They are nice young people, but woefully undertrained. First evening I asked the doorman for a taxi. He never greeted me or made eye contact. He seemed preoccupied with the headsets that he was wearing and asked me several times where I was going. \\nOn the plus side, front desk staff was very pleasant and room service and housekeeping could not have been nicer. Great chocolate chp cookies as a snack, but they weren\\'t enough to make me want to book again',\n",

The hotel is new and its room spacious with a huge bathroom with marble tub/floor. We stayed at its 1-bedroom suite. It has a pull out sofa - a nice added option. Overall, I liked the hotel and its friendly staff. But the staff and their manager were not empowered to make decisions and they could not authorize me to checkout early with refund even though the marathon was cancelled and lots of people needed a room. Unlike other luxury boutique hotel that I stayed and liked, the staff in Eventi didn't have as much pride and ownership. \\nBack to the atmosphere. The lobby is small and basic and bar on second floor but both are not as fun and lively compared to the neighbor hotel NoMad. Also, skip the Eventi hotel breakfast and head to Andaz hotel cafe across from the Main Public Library for breakfast i.e. melt in your mouth souffle pancakes and great vibe! And I agreed with the other reviewer that expansive water in the room is unnecessary.\\nThe hotel spa was below average. We went there because it was convenient. But it was super small (2 chairs sitting) and no 'space' to relax. more or less a 'in and out' thing but sadly the massage my friend and I received was not really good. Save your money and skip the spa.\",\n",

In the event I very nearly cancelled due to the awful effect of Hurricane Sandy and the uncertainty of what we would find, but the hotel gave me assurances by telephone that they were almost functioning at 100%. We were so pleased that we went ahead. The staff in the hotel were very pleasant and friendly -- and genuine, not 'have a nice day' whoever you are style. We had some very interesting chats and they had some stories to tell of the impact of the storm on themselves and friends --- but all were very positive and there was also a nice friendly atmosphere among guests who included forlorn marathon runners and some refugees and their dogs. The hotel is tremendously relaxed. We were in an incredible 20th floor room overlooking both 6th Avenue and 29th Street. Just lovely and comfortable. The bed was one of the best ever. It was certainly more spacious than other hotel rooms in big cities that we've been in. We became regulars at the evening Wine Reception and studiously managed three glasses each and also availed of the tea/coffee at reception each morning; though we did miss not having tea or coffee in the room which is after all the norm in UK hotels. Not wanting to deviate from our affection for this hotel, we do want to mention a few other aspects that may be worth consideration by the management: having to pay premium prices for drinking water in the bedroom seemed just a little mean; we didn't really enjoy the breakfast - eggs were quite runny with a strange tang and the sitting area was cold; the hairdryer had a very short cable and there was nowhere in the room really suitable to use it with a mirror; while there were dressing gowns, there were no slippers -- thick socks which served as slippers were hanging in the cupboard and could be purchased, but it's just that any hotel we have been in with robes have also had basic slippers. Oh and by the way we had a brilliant time in New York - we adored the New Yorkers who are for sure among the friendliest, warmest and most genuine people in the world. A strange time to be a tourist and we felt a little guilty to be enjoying our holiday so much when many were struggling with their daily lives!!! .\",\n",

The bar area, and restaurant are situated on the backside of the hotel, and through the back part of the bar restaurant, you look out through a glass wall of windows onto their xtra big screen hanging on the side of another building across the street! Super cool! The wine hour with appetizers daily is something you will not find in NYC period! The staff was always willing to help with recommendations, even though we are the type of people that research in the weeks prior to our trip where to go and what to do, have no fear, being a fly by the seat of your pants type of guest is perfect in this hotel! They make recs fitting to your interest, and make reservations for you, etc. They take care of it all! Since we celebrated our anniversary there in Oct during our stay, they had a bottle of wine and a fruit tray sent to our room the day we checked in! Sweet! Some have mentioned that they don't like this part of town...because it is just shy south of the hub-bub of times square, but I found that great!! We were two short blocks from the subway, and right next door to Macy's Herald Square! I also really loved not being run over by tourists when I walked out the front entrance! There was nothing inconvenient about this location whatsoever...and we wanted to spend lots of time in SOHO...so this was a perfect hotel for us!!! We cannot wait to come back and book the Eventi! Specifically, we loved Patrick, and we also had a great time talking to, and getting recommendations from TJ about restaurants to try in the city. We have suggested good friends stay there this coming weekend, and they have booked the Eventi and cannot wait to go!!! We would suggest it to anyone! you will not be sorry! Oh and PS, the pizzas on the bar menu at the restaurant are excellent! Thin crust, fresh garlic? Is this really a hotel?! Excellent!\",\n",

The location was perfectly central for shopping, dinners, broadway and the subway. The room was a good size for NY and clean. The staff was better than THE BEST!!! The concierge, Alan, was unbelievable. He got us into amazing restaurants at perfect times! He got us fantastic tickets to a great play! Gave us perfect directs and made great suggestions. He pulled off an amazing feat for my birthday by having a flowers sent to a trendy restaurant and on the table with wine chilling with the best table in the place! Both he and Bill our Bellhop, not only made great after dinner ounce recommendations but they got us on the guest list and we didn't have to wait despite huge line ups! They literally made the trip for us and will always be thought of and spoken of when we reminisce! The rest of the staff was very good as well. Bottom Line - we would stay again and recommend it to others! Thank you!!!\",\n",

They are all genuinely friendly and just nice people. I can't find enough good things to say about them. The people make the place, thus the title of my review.\\nI have spent over 60 nights this year at this hotel and consider it the very best hotel I have every been at. I say this from several perspectives (starting with the staff, above). The ground floor is stunning. The massive open area is very impressive and compares well with all but the most exclusive 5-star hotels. It is truly world class. \\nThis is a convention hotel and when it is busy there are people milling about everywhere. This can be a form of entertainment in itself. There are places one can go to escape all the noise and commotion when one needs some quiet time so don't feel intimidated by this aspect.\\nThe breakfast is amazing. The food is gourmet quality. The fruits are freshiest and tastiest I've had. Even something as simple as scrambled eggs is a real treat. Don't miss it. It is well worth the price.\\nThe location is great. It is next to convention, baseball, and basketball/concert venues. One can walk to most downtown places, but a cab is immediately available at the whistle of the bell captain. The LRT is within an easy walk, and it goes all the way to Reliant Stadium.\\nThis hotel is not cheap, but you get what you pay for (world class) - the best staff in the business, gourmet food, some great rooms with great views, tranportation on demand, and a home away from home.\",\n",

Every morning, we were greeted with a delicious breakfast bar filled with scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, waffles, bagels, fruit, coffee, juice, cold cereal, hot cereal, and more--it was wonderful! Plus, we had free bottled water available to us at all times and they have a happy hour at 5pm where we would start our evening with a few glasses of wine and snacks. The staff was personable and helpful. We especially got to know Sonny--he's the man to see when in Houston. He recommended 3 restaurants to us and they were all outstanding. I had the best steak I've ever had and Sonny pointed the way! He drove the shuttle van and took us where we need to go. Our other colleagues stayed at the Hilton, Hyatt, and Crowne Plaza. Little 'ole Best Western had them all beat!!! Our stay cost about 1/3 less and we had all the great perks!! One colleague commented that her bottled water was $3.50 at the Hilton. I cannot rave enough about this hotel. I will be returning to Houston for another conference in the future and will stay at the Best Western.\",\n",

I used the executive club for breakfast and evening snacks. The service and staff in the club was very pleasant. My one complaint was that it was so small compared to the other Westin I have stayed in. In the morning it could get really crowded in there. Housekeeping was ok; my only complaint was not one time didn’t they put in any toiletries, no body wash, lotion or anything. I even took them all out and put them in my suitcase and nothing was replaced ever. I was there for 11days. I also used self-parking garage it was painless just be careful some people drive really fast in the garage. Overall it was a pleasant stay and I would stay there again. I didn’t get to use the pool or Jacuzzi even though I stayed on the 18th floor. But it looked very nice along with the gym.',\n",

The room was a king deluxe room with a nice comfy bed, good working area, large screen tv on a swivel with HD Programming!!! a nice sitting area by the window, a very spacious bathroom with a seperate shower and a bathtub, dual sink and mirrors with excellent lighting. The full length mirror was excellently placed in the room next ro the entrance to the bathroom. The room also had a small refrigerator neatly hidden under the counter and a safe in the closet. The lounge opens around 6 for a continental breakfast, lots of choices for cereals, bagels, muffins, coffee, teas, and juices. Evening snacks were provided as well. I personally did care for the evening food\\nbut there was complimentary drinks provided until 730 and the lounge itself was open until 11p. Water, chips, soda, candies, chocolate covered pretzels all for the taking!!! Thumbs up to the lounge staff....always pleasant and smiling with a greeting to everyone. A really nice pool setting up on 18th floor overlooks the highway and on the right day, some lovely sunsets. Self parking is easy enough and probably faster than Valet service. Park on third floor of garage\\nand go right into hotel. Hertz rental car is located right in the hotel. Cheesecake Factory right across the street. Hospital right next door. Easy access onto Katy freeway 4 miles West of 610 and about 1 mile east of Highway 8. Definitely would stay again....and again and again.',\n",

I stayed at the University of Houston Hilton last year (9.2007). I was attending a conference for 5 days. I was sick and I called the front desk SEVERAL times to tell them not to cancel my reservation which was GUARANTEED with a CC because I would be there by 6 a.m. Monday morning instead of Sunday night. The reservation WAS cancelled and the hotel was booked for the entire length of my conference - no apologies at the time. I wrote a letter and finally got a \"free romance weekend night\" apology. That night was last Friday 8.1.08. First of all, we were given the \"murder central\" room at the end of the hall by the stairwell where the noise transfers extensively. The only time I have been given this room in the past is when I get a \"priceline room\" or the \"military rate\" room. Our romantic strawberries were great. And then, it started - the noise. About 9 p.m. we could hear very loud laughter. We waited to see if it would quit on it\\'s own - I AM NOT A COMPLAINER! really. We complained about the noise twice before 11 p.m. - no apologies or offer to move us to a quieter room. I was awake listening to DOORS SLAM! loud laughter, someone singing in the shower near me, and music. I finally called the front desk around 4 a.m. They said there was nothing they could do and offered to move us. WE LEFT - sleeping in my bed at home with my three dogs and cat was is more romantic! The entire hotel management and especially the front desk manager Michele K. does not have a good handle on the staff or the quality of service. The rooms ARE dated - looks like something Lucy and Dezi would have stayed in on one of their trips to California... Room Service is limited. The bathrooms are tiny with chips falling off the tiles and mold in the air filters. I contacted management again and was told there was nothing they could do about the noise!! and offered me free dinner at the crappy restaurant. I WILL NEVER STEP FOOT INTO THE UNIVERSITY HOUSTON HILTON AGAIN, unless I have to because I do attend conferences there. PLEASE contact me if you need more information....',\n",

We stayed at the property early in the week while I was in town for business (my wife came along so we could celebrate her birthday), which was helpful because the pool was not very busy but fully staffed, which meant near constant service and attention.

       "  'text': 'We stayed at the Setai last year and returned this year, on arrival at the hotel the doorman greeted us and welcomed us back and said it was nice to see us again and collected our luggage from our car,nice start to the visit. \\nGreeted at the desk and informed our room was not available yet, which was fine as it was 11.30am we had arrived in NY on the Queen Mary 2 so we were early, waited in the lounge bar area until around 1.30 room still not avail, so went out for lunch came back at 3.30 still not avail, at this point they decided to upgrade our room rather than keep us waiting any longer, which we appreciated, not sure if I would have waited any longer, obviously the no check in/out time works fantastically as long as the hotel is not full! \\nThe room was gratefully accepted and appreciated.\\nThere was a little event going on in town the United nations convention, and the hotel was a little busy with a few diplomats and presidents plus security floating around, but this did not impact on our visit at all, until one day a security guy looked me up and down (not the usual staff who always most friendly and polite) and questioned if I was staying at the hotel, maybe he thought someone wearing shorts and a t shirt would not be staying at the Setai? Flashed the room key and in we went. \\nAll went well during our four night stay until our departure, on checking the bill it had been charged to the wrong card I was assured it would be changed, got back to the UK to find the bill had been charged to my card in error, which has just been refunded to my card after eleven days, after many phone calls and emails to the hotel and visa, I am still awaiting a part refund for the difference in the exchange rates that the banks had the nerve to charge me,which amounts to a couple of hundred dollars, if the total had been a couple of hundred dollars I would not have pursued it as much but as it was $4000 it needed dealing with asap, an awful lot of work for something which should never have happened as I felt I had dealt with this before my departure on the 24th sept, everyone was very apologetic about the issue but I really could have done without all this hassle, Thanks for the stay Setai it was great except for the issue and work on my return home.\\nPS. Hopefully next time on check out I wont be asked to leave via the staff entrance (not so attractive as the hotel, concrete is not an attractive colour) so as to let Mr Clinton come in the front.',\n",

       "  'text': \"We were welcomed in a genuine and thoughtful way. Among the pleasures of the hotel was an espresso machine with all the fixings in the room. The room was lovely and we emptied the espresso supplies-delicious. The next day we left around 9am for a day of sightseeing in the city. We had a wonderful day and returned around 3:30 for another round of espresso's and a nap before dinner and a play. The day was rainy and as we walked a great deal we were soaked. So a hot shower, espresso and a nap. However, the room was not made up. By the time it was there was no time for any of the planned rest before dinner. When the room was finally made up the espresso supplies were not replenished nor were they resupplied at turn down service. Reading the ratings in more detail I see this is not a rare occurrence. The staff apologized but no explanation was given. I think the saying is you only have one time to make a good first impression. At a less exclusive property no big deal but in hundreds of stays at hotels this had only happened to me once before and not at a high end property.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I have been very fortunate to travel much of the world staying in both some of the finest and some of the most rustic accommodations, but I've never come across a worse/more rude front desk staff. Listing the positives first, the hotel is admittedly a beautifully decorated well thought out property and the head butler Brandon was fantastic. Unfortunately, I left the hotel utterly disappointed and completely enraged by the front desk staff and management.\\nWhen booking a junior suite two months out, I requested one with a terrace and asked for an early check-in depending on availability. Two weeks out I called to reconfirm the request and when the hotel called me two days out I repeated it for a third time. During check-in, my request was once again relayed, though unfortunately a terrace suite wasn't available that day nor could I check in early... no big deal. However, I was told I could move rooms the following day to have the terrace to which I agreed to.\\nLater that day when our room was ready (received no phone call btw even though we were informed we would be called), it was once again communicated we would like to move the next day. The next day when I called in the front desk staff had no idea what I was talking about, but were looking into it. I called back 20 minutes later when we had to leave for a tour and were told they didn't have an answer yet, but the manager would call. Once again, no phone call was received. \\nUpon return to the hotel, I was told they were very sorry, but room wasn't available. Of course we had not unpacked due to the promised room transfer and was quite frustrated at the huge lack of communication especially by such an expensive/highly rated hotel. Unfortunately, I did not have time to continue the discussion as we needed to change and head to a show, but informed the manager I expected him to do something to write their wrong of over promising, not communicating between staff members and not ever calling/following up with me. Once again, a phone call was promised and never received.\\nThat night upon return was my bubbling point as there was a new and very rude girl working the desk who told me essentially all I was saying was a lie and no request for a room was every made, meaning no phone calls before arriving, no communication upon check in, etc. I proceeded to go off on her and her manager who finally realized they were wrong and apologized. But guess what... nothing was ever done by them.\\nBeing in the customer service business you need to control your clients expectations and if they have simply told me the room wasn't available upon check in then no big deal. Instead they caused a huge ordeal as they lacked any resemblance of customer service or professionalism. I would never ever recommend this hotel and the frustration/stress their front desk caused essentially ruined me and my girlfriend's trip to NYC.\",\n",

The Chatwal is 1 of the listed 5 Star Hotels (List of 5 start in NYC: The Pierre; Setai Fifth Avenue; Trump SoHo New York; Trump International Hotel ; Mandarin Oriental New York; Plaza; St. Regis Hotel New York; Peninsula New York). \\nIt did not have the luxury of the open location like The Plaza or The Trump International, but it had the location history & Heritage. House in the same place with The Lamb Club, Chatwal is blessed. Luxury is defined to another dimension in this Hotel. The Guest Bathroom is a Trump card to every guest. The shower is similar to be in the rain forest in-home or Niagara in-home. It was outstanding. if you couple it with Jacuzzi, it's a topper. The in-room lighting & electronics is itself a 'show'. The closet & etc is another visual pleasure. Bed, one the best quality memory foam (coming from a memory foam user at home for 7 yrs). \\nThe pool and Jacuzzi coupled with complementary biscotti & lemon water followed by another all around pressure shower is itself a spa experience. Chatwal's attention to detail for luxury and guest is second to none.\\nThe Lamb Club, their restaurant is a wonderful and full of heritage. a true luxury is defined by Chatwal. I congratulate Mr Chatwal to stand with same line up w other 6 5-strays, if not being on the toppers. They know how to take care of guest, they know what attention to detail is!\",\n",

I was finally able to talk to their manager on duty on Saturday Nov 9th to explain the situation and rebook for the weekend Nov 9. He said he would change it for me and that I would be all set. To my surprise I called last night to confirm and was told by a different manager who was on duty that it hadn\\'t been changed, and that it was showing up as a \"No-Show\" so I would have to rebook and pay again...because it was a pre-paid reservation!!

       "  'text': \"We stayed for nearly 2 weeks at the Eventi in early October. We have been to New York a few times and this was by far the best location we have stayed at. An easy taxi or walk to all locations and perfect for getting about.\\nWe stayed in a King Deluxe City View which was great. We were meant to upgrade to a Suite but the room was so nice that we decided to avoid the hassle and requested to remain in the room. This is where my minor issue occurred. On check out the bill for the 2 night adjustment was huge...we also hadn't been told it would be assuming (probably wrongly) that the rate would remain the same as we had been paying. On the day the manager did try to help and reduce things a bit but I subsequently contacted them on my return and they were able to reduce things fully for us. It was wrong not to say the rate would change when we said we would stay but the way it was handled was superb and I would not hesitate to stay again.\\nBack to the hotel. The room was spacious and clean. The views were great and the service in the room (both room service and cleaning) was good. The lifts were a bit slow but we were there at the same time as a large French party who all seemed to leave at the same time. Certainly nothing to moan about as it was all good fun cramming into the lift!\\nWhat I do want to highlight above anything else is the fantastic and personalised service provided by one member of the front of house, Kevin Rountree. The trip to NY was planned so that I could propose to my girlfriend. Living in Hong Kong the logistics of doing this were tricky so I contacted the front desk a few weeks before to see if someone could help. That someone was Kevin who helped arrange EVERYTHING and most of it in his free time. He was even at the proposal location (a bookshop recommended by him) to set everything up on his morning off. Honestly cannot think of anywhere that has given such a personalised service and whilst we may have got lucky with Kevin specifically we could sense that the overall vibe was that people were there to help. Kevin though we have to thank you again and hope someone gives you a promotion for your efforts!\\nWe would stay and perhaps even plan to do so again in 2013. Hotel is great and we highly recommend it to everyone.\",\n",

The microwave and mini-fridge came in handy. The adjustable bed gets high marks from me. That along with the comfortable pillows made for a good night's sleep. Only negative comment would the a/c unit being a bit loud for my taste but then I'm never heard a really quiet one either. The most important thing for me is that I have a clean room and that indeed was the case. The lobby is nice and inviting. Nothing special in terms of staff service but still a job well done in check in and check out and housekeeping. There are plenty of restaurants around and a shopping mall just a few miles away.

We were celebrating our daughter's 13th birthday and had invitated a few of her teenage girlfriends to stay for an overnight. We selected this weekend because we thought there were no concerts, conferences or conventions in town and the kids could enjoy the space without having to be over supervised. To our suprise upon arrival to the hotel, the lobby was packed with guest from a huge business convention. Also, the two non-smoking connecting rooms that we had reserved were not available due to past guest smoking inside one of the room. I was dissapointed and stress out as we were traveling with 7 teenage girls and was needing to come up with a plan B very quickly. Kaitlan at the front desk was very apologetic and extremely accomodating. After a long search, She found us a suite and a near by double queen bed room to accomodate our party. She helped with keeping the birthday cake refrigerated until it was needed . The hotel manager on staff, Mr. Ruben Wong was very professional and apologized for the inconvenience to both my husband and I. He went the extra mile by providing our party with valet parking at no cost. He sent a birthday card and a plate of chocolates and fruits to our daughter from the Hilton family making her feel special. We have stayed in many hotels around the world and my husband keeps elite levels status with different hotel chains and we have to say that we were definetly amazed with the First Class Customer Services provided to us by the Houston Hilton Americas. Other hotels should learn from this well trained hospitality staff. We will recommend the Houston Hilton Americas to friends and clients and we will back here for more stays.\",\n",

This is a really great room for two folks who hog the bathroom on a normal basis because you both can get cleaned up at the same time. Sadly, we didn't have time to enjoy the restaurant or other aspects of the hotel, but it's a really beautiful place in a very upscale looking part of Houston JUST off the freeway.

Went down to the front desk the next morning and the same girl was working that checked us in, I asked again what size the beds were, she again said queen, I said they were not, but that is what I booked when I called. After a call was made, she said they are not queen beds. I then proceeded to tell her we now have a problem, I booked queens, was told at check in they were queens and was paying for queens......I wasn't paying for something I wasn't getting. Manager was notified, he called my wife while son and I was at the Yankees and they said they didn't have any other rooms available for 4 , he called back and moved us to the penthouse., it was gorgeous and more than expected. We thank you for recognizing your error and correcting it.\\nRooms are very cean, well appointed and high tech..the high tech was a bit over the top for me...keep it simple. Showers were great. Rooms were dead silent, didn't hear anything , amazing being that close to Times Square. Great location to Times Square and subway.\\nElizabeth who was the woman that checked us in was incredible to my boys and wife, great personality and gorgeous as well. \\nManpreet the butler is second to no one, pressed all our clothes and made us feel like royalty....he is one of a kind.\\nConcierge was very helpful and doorman were on top of everything when they saw you.\\nGreat hotel and service. I could have dwelled on the negative start but you could tell they truly cared about customer service and in today's works that lacking in many businesses.\",\n",

To get in on the \\'love fest\\' action they then also write good reviews and get fawned on by the management etc etc etc even though its in relaity no better than other similar products.\\nSuprisingly the one \"I don\\'t get it\" review gets no management response - so this perfectly adequate hotel becomes the 4th best in Houston - really ????? This is a sub-brand chain hotel in office central, how can that be ?\\nI have stayed here quite a few times as well as the Courtyard Marriot just across the way - I like the HGI slightly more, the Courtyard is marginally less nice overall but it is 194 in the ranking which would make this HGI just above that so here\\'s and honest review of this hotel - stayed here 3 nights this week.\\nCheck-in - friendly enough but nothing special no welcome back etc, interestingly some colleagues didn\\'t get the free breakfast coupons that come with our company rate here - arguements ensued and end result they didn\\'t get them apparently because they had booked through an agent ...........just as I had and received them - get it sorted guys !\\nRooms - nice enough but a bit dated, really think these chains should have central air con, hate the noisy wall / window units\\nCleanliness - had a good look round as others have waxed lyrical, clean enough I suppose but lots of corners not vacumed, same in bathroom so pretty average.\\nBed - really like these adjustable ones\\nToiletries replaced sometimes\\nWireless - really slow in higher rooms, spoke to reception to see if anything could be done and the answer was its working ok\\nFood - absolutley average, really nothing great to write home about, usually choose to eat out for that reason\\nBreakfast - didn\\'t bother to use my vouchers as last time cooked was very greasy so has put me off\\nCheck-in staff general - always felt I was breaking in on some gossip as I passed and it went quiet a couple of times, no friendly hello\\'s etc - pretty poor really.\\nSo, all in all a really average hotel that thinks its one of the top ones in Houston and clearly isn\\'t - can we have some more honest and realistic reviews on here please to stop this kind of thing from happening and maybe some consideration of what can actually be done better by management so they actually try.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Stayed here for a huge conference in early October that basically took over the entire city. Hotel is perfectly situated for basketball/baseball games and conference center events. There were some minor cleanliness issues- some junk in the hallways and the lobby bathroom being pretty dirty at 6am one day. Rooms have pretty much everything you need and have a nice modern decor. A corkscrew/ bottle opener in the room would have been nice though but the front desk provided one right away. Otherwise well laid out for the business traveller. The gym/pool on the top floor offer great views and there is an open deck that is great to hang out on in the evenings. At peak times the 12 elevators have a little trouble keeping up when the hotel is full- modern elevators should sense when they are near capacity and not stop at every floor to pick up passengers. Because of that and the road closures around the hotel for our conference I would like to apologize to the other guests -especially the weddings going on-that were likely pretty inconvenienced by us being there. Food and drink not cheap here either- including the coffee shop but the service was very quick and very friendly. Overall if I was back in town I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again.',\n",

Location was perfect for us -- 20 minute walk to Central Park or Time Square. Just a few blocks from Rockafeller Center (try Top of the Rock - spectacular views!!). LOTS of shopping nearby. Very safe neighborhood, felt comfortable going out late. Staff was wonderful at every level. Clean and quiet. Free WiFi. We had one bedroom suite with 2 queen beds plus sofabed, Bedroom was very spacious, lots of pillows, desk and chair and separate A/C controls. Sofabed was fairly comfortable and big enough for my 17 year old son. Tons of storage space incl. 2 closets. Refrig was nice size. Small sitting area with table and two chairs was a plus for eating takeout. Living room was great size with huge TV. Bathroom on small side but not a big deal for us. Breakfast was enough to start the day. Never had to wait for elevator. Parking right next door - get ticket voucher from front desk for $30/day. A 24 hour McDonalds is across the street and a drugstore is only 2 blocks for convenience food/drinks. Had a slight problem with TV the first night - they sent someone within 5 minutes and took care of it. Will absolutely stay here again and again...loved it!',\n",

Once we were checked in later, we found a sleek, European style hotel room (a bit small which is usual for NYC) with robes and slippers, flat screen TV, and all other amenities. The glass enclosed shower was convenient and clean. The hotel also boasts a spa, fitness center, restaurant and bar, and a veranda which looked spectacular, but which was closed due to cold weather. Complimentary wine was available from 5-6pm. The hotel is pet friendly, and was populated with a myriad of dogs (many of which we expected were pets of families displaced by Hurricane Sandy). All staff members greeted us warmly. We felt like welcomed guests. It is a bit pricey, however. We were fortunate to get a deal through a discount website. Check it out!',\n",

It is a boutique hotel so no restaurant or other typical hotel amenities, but you stay there for its location and comfort AND affordably priced! We had a suite. I slept on the pull-out sofa bed...I think the bed was broken but I was able to sleep sideways so as to not fall into the couch!! I suspect that this is not typical of their sofa beds and that I just got a lemon. But dividing a suite by 3 or 4 people makes it very affordable. We loved the neighborhood surrounding it too!

Sorella is very contemporary, sleek and simple in its design, masculine decor touches and overall inviting and warm. The hotel staff is beyond accommodating, and the rooms are spacious complete with flat panel TVs, iPod docks, and seriously comfy furniture. We stayed in a room with a view of the common area in front of the hotel. The common area is a beautiful, inviting, green area constantly teeming with activity. During the evening, we had a wonderful view of a live band and lots of people dancing and enjoying the night. The following morning, the common area played host to a slew of families with children and dogs on one end and the other end housed a group of people doing aerobics and stretching/strengthening exercises. Walking out of the hotel on the back side, we spotted MULTIPLE exotic cars throughout our stay parked in the valet area. Each time we exited the hotel through those doors, we spotted different cars including Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Porsches, Audi R8, etc. It was basically a free high end car show with our stay. The Houston Motor Club is housed within Citycentre, and there's always a gorgeous car somewhere to drool over. The M Club Bar and Lounge is a MUST SEE for couples wanting a VERY SEXY nightclub and a fascinating study in human nature. ;) You will have your choice of fine dining, excellent shopping, and entertainment. Everything you'll need is within walking distance, and Citycentre feels like a self-contained Stepford village catering to your every whim. You will NOT be disappointed with Hotel Sorella and the Citycentre experience. We can't wait to go back!!!\",\n",

Hotel hallways were nice - more updated - someone did some renovating here - then you slide the card into your room door - and...well, let\\'s just say it ain\\'t the Hilton! Oh, wait - it was the Hilton!\\n4. Our room was small and weirdly spaced, there was a weird sliding closet and a giant vent above one of our beds. The TV was tiny - the reviews are right - it was laughable! I laughed.\\n5. At 3am our neighbor came home. We heard his whole conversation for the next hour. Seriously - it was like he was in the room with us. We determined that the vent was to blame. We mentioned it to the front desk, their response: \"We\\'re very sorry\"\\n6. Cold water. Came in to take a shower after a long day - after letting the water run for about 10 minutes the temperature never went from cold to hot. Called the front desk to complain, the response \"I never heard that before.\"\\n7. The restaurant was questionable...a grand white iceberg salad was delivered with chemical carrot slices, the menu seemed to be aiming at something - but overall was pretty random. The food was just okay...just like everything else at the University of Texas Hilton - just okay...\\n8. Parking system is kind of dated. Visitors get video game tokens to feed the parking machine. One for every exit.\\n9. Nice sewing kits though.',\n",

While the hotel itself is fine - my rooms have always been comfortable and clean, no noise issues for me. My coworkers complained about not enough hot water one morning during our recent stay from March 5-6. I have also eaten at Eric's restaurant in the hotel several times since 2006. The experience at the restaurant has definitely been uneven, especially during this last stay March 5-6, 2008. The service was slow on for both breakfast and dinner. My food at dinner was acceptable, but one of my coworkers returned what she ordered for dinner. A manager should have come out to see what the problem is when a customer returns a meal. At breakfast the next day I discovered a smashed tomato in the carpeting that was left over when the restaurant was not properly cleaned from the night before. This is not a good sanitary procedure. \\nThe hotel is fine, but if you are going to be in Houston for more than a day or two, you might want to explore other dining options than Eric's.\",\n",

When I also manage to get the same exceptional service and attention as those who can easily afford such luxury, it\\'s a very rare combination indeed. But the Sherry hit a home run on both counts and I think that I\\'ve found my special go-to place to stay. From the youngest to the oldest employee, from the early morning/late night front desk staff to every single elevator captain and bellop, ALL were unfailingly polite and cheerful! You really get the sense that they love their jobs and they are super happy to serve. Each time my mother and I came through the door, I felt as though we were truly welcomed \"home\". In fact, it got to be nothing to just hang out in the lobby and get the best tips on where to shop or get the best coffee and brunch. I am serious...this staff can give the top hotels in NYC some lessons in true hospitality.\\nRoom 211, which I think was a wonderful upgrade on their part, is fit for any special occasion. Spacious, beautifully appointed with a big screen TV and a gazillion cable stations, a wonderful large bathroom, lots of light , and a birds-eye view of the CBS Early Show studio....not to mention a corner of the famous corner anchored by The Plaza Hotel. There were times when we just felt like \"staying put\", but we didn\\'t miss out on the buzz of the city. It was right outside to see!\\nWant to get away quick? The subway stop is right around the corner of the hotel. You can be in Union Square (HUGE Filene\\'s and Whole Foods Market) in less than 25-minutes. Feel like you need to commit to an East Side -vs-West Side experience? Don\\'t bother. You can do both without much effort with cabs and cross-town buses all around -- not to mention horse drawn carriages. An escape to the more magical? Famous Central Park, which can seem postively other-worldly in the quiet morning sunlight, is steps aways.\\nWhen in NYC, we usually stay at The Casablanca, The Elysee, and The Lucerne. Each has a lot to recommend it. But I honestly have to say that I am going to take time to check out the Sherry first before I look elsewhere from now on. If you really want to kick your NYC experience up a notch, you should too. You\\'ll be really glad that you did!',\n",

Lots of renovation in the immediate area made for lots of scaffolding and congestion, but it didn't really impact our enjoyment of the hotel and location. We would happily recommend The Iroquois and would certainly stay there ourselves on any future trip to NYC.\",\n",

Also, they took the towels for washing even though we hung them up and let us run out of shower gel and toilet tissue by not replacing them regularly enough. \\nLocation was good in the sense that most of the areas were walkable and close to Penn station and subway, but bear in mind the area it’s in is nothing special and nowhere particularly close for brunch or drinks. \\nWe were looking forward to the excellent service they publicise, especially as it was our wedding anniversary and first time in New York, but the girl who checked us in was uninterested in our excitement and we got no thoughtful freebies. The doorman Doug gave us a welcome greeting every night as if he’d never seen us before which was funny at first and then annoying. \\nLet down by the service, but would still stay there again though as overall a decent room/bathroom/location.',\n",

The bed was comfy, the bathroom was clean, the room service was prompt, the view is lovely and the location is convenient to downtown and the theatre district. My only complaints would be with service. The reservation system is strange. When I made my original reservation, I got a great price, but when my husband's schedule worked out for him to join me and I called back to extend my stay, I was given two choices: I could cancel my whole reservation and book 6 continuous days at a MUCH higher rate or I could make a new reservation for the two additional days at a more reasonable rate but there was no guarantee that I would get to keep the same room? The woman who checked me at the front desk was courteous and very helpful, but subsequent visits to the front desk were always a crap shoot...would the staff be in a good enough mood to help me? The doormen don't try to remember you. The doorman that I tipped the first day when he brought in my bags, who greeted me the next day as if he remembered me, still hassled me for my room key the following night when I went to get into the elevator. The worst service had to do with housekeeping. The first two days, no one bothered me when the Do Not Disturb sign was up, and when I left the room around 11am on those days, I called Housekeeping and told them my room was available to clean. The third day, at around 10:30am, Housekeeping CALLED ME, saying the Do Not Disturb sign was up, did I want any towels? I would expect that in a cheap motel, but the prices here do not reflect a cheap motel. When I complained, instead of apologizing, the staff made excuses. There is no excuse for calling a room when the Do Not Disturb sign is up. There are nicer hotels for this price. I would probably not stay here again.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I recently spent a few days at the Chatwal Hotel in NYC. Let me tell you that a few days was just not enough. I wish I could have stayed longer! \\nPeter, the doorman, greeted us and right away I knew there was something special about this NYC hotel: THE PERSONAL TOUCH that is just lacking in some bigger hotels. Yes, the Chatwal is a smaller hotel, but the secret to its success is that it has a BIG heart. This is very evident in their staff. I have traveled all over and have never received such service from a wonderfully friendly, well-trained, professional staff. Brandon, head butler, came to our room to check on us personally and to see that we had everything we needed. Tall, stately, and with classic white gloves, he certainly represented the hotel well.\\nI talked mostly to two people at the front desk, Lance and Elizabeth, who were polished, knowledgeable, and again, very friendly. When I called for assistance, I think I always talked to them, too.\\nAs to location, The Chatwal has a prime location, just a few blocks away from Times Square, and we were able to walk nearly everywhere we wished to go.\\nI took full advantage of our fabulous concierge, Nick, who was even able to get us tickets to “Phantom,” with very short notice. He also booked our tea time at the Palm Court and gave us some very good advice as to where to shop and sight see. He handed us directions that we could take with us, which we greatly appreciated.\\nOur suite was what I would call “modern classic,” and I would define that as, extremely comfortable, but very high tech. I don’t think I ever did figure out all the buttons on the toilet and the heated seat would actually spoil you. The TV in the bathroom is an interesting touch. The shower…okay, I’d like to live in the shower. It had a huge rain shower head and it the entire bathroom was done in black marble with silver chips that made you think of the moon against a dark sky. We also appreciated the Internet connection and wireless service.\\nWhen you stay at the Chatwal, don’t forget to book something in the spa, which is on the lower level. I had a pedicure and Lupe was just a joy to chat with…and she did a great job on my feet and toes!\\nWe had a delicious breakfast one morning. Do NOT pass up the pastries. You can go back on your diet when you get home! The almond croissants and pain au chocolat were better than some I have gotten in fabled French restaurants. We had dinner one night there and I just had to ask who the chef was, since it was such a delightful meal. I was told that the chef is Jeffrey Zacharian and you may have seen him on Iron Chef, as a winner. I was also told that he is going to do a show for the Food Channel in the future. That should be interesting.\\nOur savior was the Chatwal’s Assistant Manager, George Petkovic. I think this man can be everywhere at once! His energy is boundless. He called us the morning we were scheduled to leave the hotel to inform us that our flight reservations had been cancelled for that evening. The airline had not given him a reason for the cancellation, but within 15 minutes he had gotten us alternative reservations. Since we had to leave a bit earlier than we planned, George had also booked a car for us. After doing all that, he came to our suite to check on us and offer his assistance, but we were all packed. The next thing I knew, we were safely in the car, heading for the airport. What amazing service!\\nAs I said at the beginning, I wish I could have stayed longer and whenever I am in NYC, you may find me at the Chatwal Hotel.',\n",

I stayed at the Setai as there was a UN event on and many of my usual hotels were fully booked. I had a one bedroom suite with views over the empire state building. \\nThe guys on the door as you arrive are not training to a high enough standard. They are more like security guys that proper 5 star door men. I asked for a cab on several times during my stay and on more than one occasion something distracting them and they forgot me. The bar on the ground level is OK but not 5 star by any means. The restaurant on the 2nd floor is better and breakfast is a good standard. The rooms are decorated in a modern clean style but the fittings are not of a high quality and already have a lot of damage. The carpets were a neutral cream colour and were stained badly. The location, versus the price, versus the experience dont add up! The gym is a room with no windows and no atmosphere. Its dark and not inspiring to train. This is a shame as there is some good equipment. I trained in there once and then went to another local gym. The Spa is ok but there are much better ones in less expensive hotels.\\nI lived in NYC on Park Ave for several years so know the city very well and this is not good value or a good enough standard. When i read back some of the other reviews i think this is a reflection of what folks are used to. If you are used to travelling and staying 5 star, this is not the hotel for you.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Despite a few bad experiences I would say most of the staff here are great and staying here can be a terrific experience. The hotel is very nice and modern. There are lots of little touches that set it apart, like providing free beverages when you arrive, free beverages and snacks in your room, and a free wine happy hour in the evenings. The restaurant was very good, with very good service. The location is also very central near the library and Bryant Park. \\nOur check in was great. We arrived about noon and our room was not ready. We were given coffee and sparkling water while bags were checked in. Kelly took great care of us. Later Amy brought us to our room and also took great care of us. The room was larger, modern with a lounge couch, with a slight view of the Library down the street, but near the elevators. It seemed like a nice modern styled room, which we like. Then night time came. I could hear a high pitched noise from behind the walls that had been covered up by New York traffic during the day. And the noise was even worse deeper in the room and bathroom, away from the windows. I took my Ambient sleeping pill to try and block it out, but only got about four hours sleep and woke up to a splitting headache from the noise. Since we were staying three nights, I asked my husband to talk to the front desk about moving us to a new room. He was told the hotel was full and that they would send up an 'engineer' to look at the problem. Unless they were going to break through walls, I knew the problem could not be fixed by a handyman they would send up. I checked on Hyatt's website and found out they had lied to my husband because the hotel was not full. Next we both went down to the front desk to confront the man (sorry don't know his name) about the dishonesty and to let him know this problem was beyond a handyman repair problem. As I was trying to express my thoughts about the situation he kept saying 'I hear what you are saying, I hear what you are saying' which could not be true because he kept interrupting me and cutting me off from trying to tell him what I was saying. Finally he left and Kelly, the great and very professional lady who checked us in, came and took care of everything. She didn't question our need to move, tell us it was an engineering problem, lie about the hotel being full, or argue with us in any way. She just very gracefully took care of the problem. While we went out and enjoyed the day, she had our bags moved to another room (no high pitched noise, away from the elevators) and she also had a complementary bottle of champagne sent up. Kelly took a very bad situation that would have had us checking out of the hotel that day, and turned the rest of our stay into a wonderful experience. Instead of us being upset about the bad room and poor treatment, we instead had a very nice stay thanks to her. She is a real asset to the hotel, very professional and personable.\\nRegarding the staff and the wine happy hour, it is also spotty. Our first night, (Thursday Sept 27th), a lady was working the happy hour area. She saw us come in but she was having a conversation with a customer (about the California coast) so we sat there for over 10 minutes without any acknowledgement we were there. Finally my husband went into the lobby to ask for assistance and Amy, the nice and professional lady who took us to our room, came in and served us wine. The the lady who left us waiting for service gave us dirty looks after this, like we had done something wrong. The next night however, we went to the wine happy hour and received excellent service from a very friendly man. He was three times busier than the lady from the night before but was giving everyone great friendly service. \\nOur waiter in the restaurant was also very good, professional, friendly and efficient. It was nice having a very good restaurant in the hotel, especially after exhausting days in New York.\\nThis is a very good hotel with good amenities, some great service and some poor service. It is the extremes that can make it unpleasant. That said, when it works the hotel is a great place to stay.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"We stayed for 6 nights at the Beacon, in a 2 room suite (BR plus sitting room/kitchen). The hotel is located close to the Metro, a few blocks from Central Park, a half hour walk across the Park to the Museum of Natural History and a little further to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It was a quiet oasis, particularly after the .shock of arriving at bustling Penn station. Rooms are well appointed and comfortable, and access to restaurants and food is easy (try Isabella's restaurant a few blocks away and buy great food at the supermarket opposite). The desk and concierge staff are efficient and helpful.\\nOnly 3 weaknesses. The bathroom in the suite we were in, while adequate, was very small, one of the smallest we have ever experienced in many years of travelling - no place to leave toiletries, and it could be uncomfortable for some travellers - ask for a room with a large bathroom! Second, there was no washing up detergent provided requiring purchase of same, with a lot wasted at the end of the stay. And third, the airconditioning is old and very noisy, sufficient to wake one up during the night if you have it going in the same room - we shut the bedroom aircon down and relied on the second unit in the sitting room to keep the room cool, which worked well for us. If you are in a single room and a light sleeper, watch out for this.\",\n",

Location is fantastic, with Central park 3 blocks away and the 72nd St subway station less than 3 minutes walk. The area is a bit more residential than Times square and we felt perfectly safe day and night without having to battle crowds. The Fairway market across the road is fantastic, with plenty to tempt the whole family and the kitchenette in the room is well stocked enough to prepare whatever treats you buy there. Directly below there is a great restaurant which serves generous helpings of simple but well executed meals, with a brilliant range of desserts (go the Key Lime Pie!). The staff are friendly and the rooms are spacious by NY standards, with everything you need from cable TV to coffee facilities. There is even a Century 21 about 10 minutes walk away for bargain hunting.\\nBottom line - if you are travelling to NY with kids I would look very seriously at the Beacon. It's got everything you need: space, plenty of food options, easy transport, an amazing park that's an easy piggyback ride away and a very safe family friendly location.\",\n",

I booked one night on my credit card points and then the other 2 nights cash. We get the keys and get up to our room and it was right next to the elevator. We walk in the room and all we can hear is the dinging of the elevator and people getting on and off. We went back down and requested another room. They said it was because we booked through points that we didn't get a very good room. We then requested an upgrade which they gave us for an extra $15 a night. The only reason I write this is because if you book there cheapest room this is what you will get.\\nThe good things are the room decor is awesome and my mom and I loved the bathroom because it was big with counter space for all of our makeup and curling irons. The bed was really comfortable and clean rooms. The other great thing is they offer a free shuttle to take you around downtown area. It will pick you up and take you anywhere you want to go.

At that time, they had a cute little London cab that shuttled you to downtown destinations and staff all around ready to help. We stayed on a Friday and could see the Friday night fireworks at the Astros game from our window. On our second stay (now under different management), the rooms are the same but there is far less staff to assist with bags or other things. We really like to uniqueness of the building's history and the decor is beautiful. The rooms are very nice and feel more romantic than a typical hotel room. Overall, we would definitely return and have recommended to friends & family.\",\n",

The waitress was spotty all night. There are not enough seats for the room. One per table. By the end of the night the waitress apparently thought we were blitzed and tried to run a non-itemized tab by us. I asked for the itemized tab and found that a 20% tip had been added in at her (the waitress) discretion. I followed up with an email to the general manager. He responded that he would take this response very seriously and would follow-up when all parties had been identified. We are now in June 2012. Apparently the investigation is quite serious and lengthy, as I have still not heard any follow-up from him. I don't know what that says to you...\",\n",

First it was hard to find the actual hotel as it is in a complex with tons of shops and finding the actual entrance was a challenge. Then parking was an atrocity. When I left the garage and try to return late Friday or Saturday lines form going in and out and once in, I had to search for a parking spot. And the hotel isn't attached to the garage so imagine hauling your luggage quite a ways to the entrance of the hotel. Not fun! Especially in hot humid Houston!! That design plan didn't make any sense to me.\\nOnce inside the hotel, check in was smooth and staff was friendly. The room was beautiful, clean and very contemporary. I used the gym one morning and it was adequate. I didn't eat at the continental breakfast as I was out and about during my stay. \\nIt was a decent stay overall but probably won't stay here again because I was traumatized by the parking situation.\",\n",

Tiny tiny tiny bathroom.... did I mention tiny? Not even the newer curved curtain rods to keep the nasty shower curtain from sticking to you.\\nNo diamond perks outside of the larger room - no dining chits or exec level. No pool. No gym onsite but you can use the one on campus (ah no thanks). $6/day parking which you have to get tokens from the front desk to use. \\nVery noisy - lots of traffic noise & people milling around outside (oh yeah it's ON the university!). \\nOne and only plus - great Hilton bedding so I'll give them 1 dot for that.

We came to New York City to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary and see all of the typical sites - from the southern tip and the WTC to Central Park - and this hotel's location was perfect. Times Square was two blocks away, all the main theatres were 2-4 blocks away, and major subway stops were also only a couple of blocks at most. And because of it's nearness to the theatre district, you had a plethora of restaurants to chose from.\\nThe hotel itself was immaculate and in a very safe area, surrounded by other botique hotels, restaurants, and nice bars - always felt safe. The rooms were large enough, for NYC, and the ammenites were great - other than the fact that you had to call for ice; no ice machines. Be sure and check out the Tavern's Keep cocktail bar on the first floor - they serve 1800-1920s era classic cocktails, with top notch ingredients and great presentation.\\nThe front desk staff was good enough, but Vanessa, the Chief Concierge was fabulous. She took care of all of the tasks I needed done in advance - arranging car service for us from Newark, getting a reservation at one of the finest restaurants in NYC for our anniversary, printing out Empire State Building tickets, etc. She even took care of a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates for our anniversary - very nice.\\nThe combination of location of the hotel, cleanliness and ammenities, and professionalism of staff made The Iroquois Hotel the perfect choice. I would not hesitate to stay there again, and Vanessa helped us make our 25th wedding anniversary a VERY special occassion.\",\n",

(44th between 5th and 6th ave).\\nAs such it is ideally situated for Grand Central and the Theatre District.\\nIf you don't mind the walk, Central Park is not too far and hardcore shoppers will go crazy for the number of high end stores around this area (Macy's is 10 blocks south and 2 avenues over).\\nWe however, found that many of the places we wanted to visit, required a short cab ride (Chelsea, West Village, Lincoln Center). Cabs are easy to get and inexpensive - plus you can pay by card at no extra charge these days.\\nIf you are looking for a relaxing slice of NY life, this area is to be avoided. If you enjoy hustle and bustle - the centre of the action is right here. Bear this in mind when choosing a room in the hotel - if you are at the front of the building, you need to be high up.\\nWe stayed in two different rooms. The first room was a classic room with 2 double beds in the middle of the hotel on the 4th floor - it had views of a burnt out building and (because of the buildings shape) also afforded an excellent view into a neighbouring guests' room.\\nThis room had a small thin bathroom and a strange bath/shower arrangement with sliding doors and this made it difficult to get in and out. The decor however, was extremely nice. \\nWe extended our stay and moved to a Suite at the front of the hotel on the 8th floor. This consisted of a lounge with two sofas, a desk and two armchairs, a chest of drawers, some tables and a large TV plus mini fridge. Then a bedroom with a US King / UK superking bed, plus an armchair with footstool, a chaise long style bench, a chest of drawers, a couple of tables and another large TV. Also a very thin closet. The bedroom leads onto a beautifully decorated bathroom with a separate show and jacuzzi bath and lots of towels plus robes.\\nWe loved the mattress and linens in both of the bedrooms we stayed in. I will be investigating purchasing the mattress for our new house.\\nOne major drawback for us, was the low lighting levels in both of these rooms. At some point in the past, the hotel decided to remove the central light fixture from each room, leaving beautiful but somewhat impractical mood lighting as the only light source (lamps, picture spots etc). At times we even turned the TV on to provide more lighting! In our first room, we asked for an extra lamp - which was some help but I believe they use low wattage/energy saving bulbs, so not a complete solution.\\nThe service in this hotel was excellent. Nothing was too much trouble for the friendly and resourceful staff. This was particularly helpful when I was taken ill and required special considerations.\\nOther small but nice features of this hotel, are the switches on the back of the door, which can be turned red for DO NOT DISTURB or green, so that a member of staff can ring your doorbell for service.\\nThe library downstairs is very small but comfortable and there is a good selection of books/papers, plus computers with internet. There is also free and speedy wifi throughout the hotel.\\nWe would definitely stay again if we needed a comfortable bed in midtown again.\",\n",

I clarified that I didn't want to charge the phone merely make a single call. Once again, stony faced refusal with no explanation. I wasn't rude or aggressive, i'm a smartly dressed Brit in my mid 40s.

       "  'text': 'My husband I had a get away to New York 8/24-26 and we stayed at the Chatwal based on a recommendation from a good friend that frequents the hotel. We had high expectations given the trusted recommendation and that Joel Freyburg\\'s (the GM) assistant assured my husband that we would be treated like VIPs for our special trip. I have to say that I was very let down. First let me recognize the hotel for all that was great about it. The location is fantastic- close to Time Square but on a quiet street that allows you to escape. The design and furnishings in the hotel were top notch. The hotel had an art deco feel in the lobby and the room was well appointed and the furniture, appliances/technology was first class. There was a TV built into the bathroom vanity which surprisingly I enjoyed. There was a rain shower and also a hand held- very nice shower but more to tell on that in a moment.... And my favorite feature was the toilet. I know it sounds crazy but the seats were heated and the bidet was perfect! And lastly the spa was great and my massage was excellent. \\nSo where did it fall short you ask? The service (with the exception of the bell and door men who were great). All presented a friendly aim to please spirit and the white gloves were a nice touch but the service fell apart in the execution. It started upon my arrival. Our room wasn\\'t ready which was fine so I asked the concierge for a spa recommendation. I did not know they had a spa in the hotel and his response was \"Well what about our spa, is it too expensive?\". Rule number one, never assume anything about someone\\'s finances. I ended up going to the spa in the hotel and that is when the second incident occurred. After my massage I asked if I could go up to my room in the spa robe. The spa agreed and called to the front desk to have my keys brought down to the spa so that I would not have to go to the main lobby. We waited for 25 minutes for my key that never arrived (after 2 additional calls to the front desk) and finally I had to go and get my own key in my robe. The third incident was that I did not know how to make the shower water warm (not the hotel\\'s fault) so on the first night of our stay we called for help and they said they would send someone up. After waiting and hearing nothing I took a cold shower. I called early that next morning and the engineer was not in, so once again I could not get help with the shower until after we were scheduled to leave for our breakfast reservation so I took my second cold shower that am. I am assuming that the engineer did fix the shower because it worked great that evening but after 2 cold showers you would think someone would let us know that it was handled and ensure that we knew how to use the shower appropriately. At this point I was done. \\nThe final kicker for me was that when asked if we enjoyed our stay the day of our departure, I politely expressed my dissatisfaction and the lady at the front desk kindly apologized and asked to make it up to us on our next visit. While I believe she was sincere, offering to rectify an issue on some future date that may never occur is a service faux pas. You can not assume you will get a second chance to make something right. Especially not after failing the first time at $~600 per night.',\n",

It was a tremendous experience, from the vintage 1930s style to the beautiful decor and accouterments. However, the best part by far are the people. Elizabeth at the front desk is both professional and warm - a difficult balancing act. All the front desk people mirror this style. Nick at the concierge desk was helpful, friendly, very professional and eager to assist. The butler, the bellmen and the doormen all reflect a bias towards friendly service. Everyone made us feel very much at home. Be sure to stop for dinner at the Lamb's Club, Geoffrey Zakarian's outstanding restaurant, accessed from within the hotel. We were lucky enough to spend some time with him. Again, food and ambience at the highest level. All-in-all, a wonderful place to stay - and within easy walking distance from the theaters.\",\n",

Wether you had the view or not would not bother me but do ask for a high floor, you will still hear some noise from the street but it's that buzzy sort of NY noise that you learn to appreciate after a while.this Hotel is absolutely First Class in every way. The rooms are Huge by New York standards and the modern decor is very classy. Beds are ultra comfortable, the women will love the massive wardrobe and bathroom and everything you can ask for is in the room, nespresso coffee machine , fridge full of complimentary sodas , water etc... After walking the streets of New York all day it is an absolute delight to come back to this fantastic room. Being a relatively new hotel every conceivable thing is new and works . Internet is free and fast. The gym is well appointed , plenty of brand new equipment, free water and fruit.we did not dine in the hotel there are just too many other great places to eat in New York. We did have room service one evening and it was absolutely delicious. What really makes this hotel is the staff. They are genuine, friendly , courteous and treat everyone with a warm smile. From the doorman to the front desk to concierge, the cleaning staff, the charming man who fills your fridge up every day. I could not say how pleasant they all are . The management of this hotel are doing a wonderful job and everyone should be congratulated . In nNew York you get what you pay for so don't be put off by having to pay $700-$850 a night for these types of rooms , they are worth every cent.thankyou Setai , we will definitely be staying here again when we come to New York.\",\n",

The bedroom was on the far opposite end of the suite, separated by the bath area; there was a great view of the NY public library and the room was relatively large...flat screen & corner love seat. As for the bath area, it was amazing. It had the same modern, gorgeous shower found in the other andaz rooms, and of course a large soaking tub in the center room surrounded by two huge closets.

We did have a problem with the air condition system – but after four tries it was corrected on the fourth day of our stay. We found the staff very friendly – naturally somewhat busy as it is a large hotel. The elevators don’t work properly. Almost every day one of the three elevators was out of order and under repair, and we had one incident were the elevator wouldn’t stop. A bit scary. As we lived on the 10.th floor that was a problem –especially on the day we left as we had to take the elevator going up from the 10.th floor with the luggage as it was always full when stopping on the way down. That has to be fixed.\\nThere are so many restaurants nearby – from the little diner Viand next door ideal for breakfast to Luxembourg on 70.d and Coppola on 79.th\\nThe room was quiet – we asked for a view but didn’t get it – I take the view must be wonderful from the top floors. For a morning jog the central park is very close.\\nThere is free internet in the hotel even in the rooms– more hotels should think this way! \\nAdding to this the convenient situation of Fairways – a very good supermarket across the street - it was a good experience to stay at the Beacon – with a few flaws.\\nWe will certainly return.',\n",

We try to stay in a different area each time we come. We loved the Beacon Hotel, it has a fabulous location on Broadway and 75th, and as others have said it's in more of a residential area. The subway is a short walk away, 2 small blocks to be exact and there is a supermarket across the road. The apartment we stayed in was immaculate and spacious with a kitchenette and a lovely view . We are from Australia and I couldn't believe the amount of Aussies that were staying at this hotel, it was like a little piece of home in the biggest city in the world. Will definitely stay here again on our next trip to New York, really enjoyed our stay at this hotel and throughly recommend it.\",\n",

The spa (which I visit frequently) was lovely as always - every masseuse I've had is excellent and the ambience is very nice (despite the fact that you have to walk through the gym area when going between the spa waiting room and the massage rooms). \\nUnfortunately, everything else was subpar. The room decor was uninspiring; the layout was ineffective; the curtains were difficult to maneuver; the carpet was stained throughout the entire suite; the toliet dripped endlessly. The one nice thing I'll say about the room is the bed was pretty comfortable (not the best I've slept on, though). The in-room dining was soooo disappointing. It took more than an hour to arrive, was incredibly expensive, and just plain wasn't good. I did not enjoy eating it. The entire hotel experience was not at all worthy of the cost - more than $400.00 for one night with room service for 1 - and left me feeling disappointed that I spent my birthday there.\\nI did not use the pool or fitness area so can't comment on those.\",\n",

Some dating as far back as 1911. The streetcars moving about gave you the feel of San Francisco without the hills. I would also like to mention a few things in particular that I noticed but are not reasons to not stay at this hotel: (1) None of the staff, i.e. front desk, valet, concierge...etc. I encountered had on name badges; therefore, I could not address them by name or single anyone out for providing good service; (2) I did not like not having easy access to ice. You had to call the front desk for ice; (3) The hotel did not have a gift shop on site. I have a tradition of sending post cards from places I\\'ve visited and getting \"shot glasses\" for family and friends. Unfortunately, I had to venture out to get these items. It would have been convenient to purchase them from the hotel gift shop. Overall, my experience at this hotel was very, very good.

And Erica, Miss Erica...was a gem! She was part smiling and lovely front desk expert, concierge, and restaurant critic. The other front desk staff were just as helpful when I talked to them but Erica seems to be there all of the time so make sure to ask for her. I made several (daily) special requests and they were on it. \\nI did not use the spa so can\\'t comment on that. I had the breakfast every day which was good. The rest of food from room service to lunch and appetizers was fair to good (although DO NOT have the gumbo). \\nI would say this area of downtown is the best for short stays. there are enough restaurants to walk to in pinch and you will be happy with them. But take the hotel up on the shuttle and explore downtown for some of the excellent restaurants that are more than a mile. The shuttle is very usefull, just don\\'t count on it to be readily available if you need to be somewhere asap because they are super busy.',\n",

       "  'text': \"First off, the price for this place on a weekend was a steal. If you can get rooms for $119-$130 a night, it is extremely worth it. Hopefully they don't raise them too high, but this hotel could probably easily be priced much higher, but then again they are the experts so they know what they're doing. They attracted me, didn't they? \\nWe stayed a Friday and Saturday night, three day weekend in Houston. The only major downside would have to be that it's on the Katy Freeway, so coming in on Friday from the east can be a pain, unless you take the beltway around. Exit I-10 East from the Beltway all the way on the west side of town and you get your own dedicated exit to Gessner and the hotel. Made things much easier than coming across straight on I-10. \\nValet parking isn't cheap. You can park yourself for cheaper. But the valet staff was really helpful and professional. You won't be disappointed using them. \\nChecking in was about as painless as I've ever experienced, plus they registered me into their rewards program too, didn't take long at all. The elevators are key access above the third floor for added security. Most modern hotels have this. \\nThe room was only a traditional yet it was much larger than I was imagining. On the 7th floor. It had an excellent view, large floor to ceiling windows. It had a good size refrigerator. The bathroom shower had two shower heads. The tub didn't drain very quickly, but it wasn't an issue for me. Also, the phone calls to valet were very staticy. Wish wifi or computer access was free. Read that it wasn't, but we didn't use it, so I can't totally say for certain. \\nThere is an open patio area on the 18th floor, hot tub, infinity pool that is 3-4 feet, large sitting area and fitness area. It was really nice and the breeze for a late spring day was great. In winter, it could get cold up there. \\nI didn't eat in the hotel besides the bar snacks so I can't rate the food. The bar, 024, was superb. Great service and drinks for reasonable prices to other major bars in major cities. \\nThe location is really great. It's off Gessner at Memorial City Mall. There is a skybridge to the mall. They have Target, Macy's, Apple Store, sports stores, etc. For food, they have a food court, plus a sports bar, California Pizza Kitchen, Cheesecake Factory and a Tex Mex place although it was more like line up service, not a traditional restaurant. \\nNoise wasn't an issue in the room. I heard an ambulance once for the nearby hospital. Storms came through and although I could see the lightning, I never heard the thunder. The beds are very comfortable, a ton of pillows, too many for me. And the bedspread kind of got me hot but I just kicked it off. The bed itself was very comfortable. Huge flat panel tv also with a lot of channels. \\nOn the weekend, the drive on the Katy wasn't a problem at all into the city. You won't regret staying here, especially for the price. I'd say anything under $180-200 is good, under $130-140 is great at this place.\",\n",

Good location and easy access to the highway and the businesses in the area. I will stay here again and again anytime I am in the area.',\n",

Times Square is within walking distance - around 30 minutes away. \\nThe strangest thing about this hotel was that the hotel bar shut at 10pm. I have never been anywhere with such an early closing time, and to find that hotel in a 24 hour a day kind of city such as New York was really surprising. It was disappointing not to be able to have a quick drink after being out for the evening. \\nOverall, it is a classy hotel - it just did not \"wow\" me as much as I was hoping or expecting.',\n",

It\\'s perfect - you are in the heart of Manhattan and at the same time the area is not as overcrowded and dirty as Times Square for instance. However, it\\'s the only good thing I can say about this hotel.\\nThe lady who met us at the reception tried to be friendly, however as far as I understood she was just a replacement since they were understaffed. And of course, she didn\\'t know the breakfast time and some other details, but that\\'s fine. At least she tried to be nice. Even though we arrived at 4 pm, they didn\\'t prepare the room and after 10 hour flight we had to wait before they cleaned it up and filled the minibar. The room itself was probably the biggest disappointment. Since I\\'m a diamond member with Hyatt, I usually get very nice rooms, when I stay at their hotels. They state that they will give you the \"best room available\" However, at Andaz they gave me most likely one of the worst. It was very small, with a view on an ugly inner court and worn-out furniture.\\nOn top of it, most of the waiters at the restaurant on the ground floor are rude and unhelpful. Even though they can easily charge up to $200 per person for dinner, the quality of service is not there. And also on the next day after I checked out, I received a text from my bank saying that you card was charged for $75 by Andaz hotel. When I gave them a call, they told me that it was for breakfast on our last day. And they were genuinely surprised when I told them that breakfast is always complimentary for diamond members. So I had to wait for another week before I received my money back. And of course no one apologised for that.\\nSo overall it was very poor experience and I wouldn\\'t recommend this hotel to anyone',\n",

The Hotel Sorella just has that ambiance of class. From the time you enter the main entrance which is a wood staircase to the time you check in, to the time you walk down the hallway, to the time you go to your room, the atmosphere is one of class. There is so much detail in the decor. It really is a beautiful hotel. The check in was quick but the the receptionist was very friendly and helpful as she explained the amenities. We had a corner room which had a great view of the courtyard, swimming pool, and a lot more of the City Centre. The room was very big with a king size bed, a 42\" TV, a couch, a lounge chair, a round table and 4 chairs. The bathroom had a walk in shower and top of the line hair care items. Again, the room and bathroom had so many fine details that just separates it from the normal hotel. The hotel also has an outstanding restaurant, Bistro Alex . The food and attention from the wait staff was above and beyond. There is a club/bar known as the Mona Lisa which along with everything else in the hotel just exudes class. A continental breakfast was served in the morning starting at 6:30 which was unusual for a Sunday morning. It consisted of a variety of fruits, dry cereals, pastries, and breakfast drinks including made to order specialty coffees. You had the option of eating in a very open lounge area or outside on the balcony.\\nThe area around the hotel is known as the City Centre with multiple places to eat from fast food type places to really nice restaurants. There are places to shop, a movie theater, and a family friendly commons area where live music was being played and kids were playing on a turfed area as people sat around the perimeter and ate, drank or just watched.\\nThere are nice hotels, good hotels and then there is the Hotel Sorella--a classy hotel.',\n",

Place has free parking, a simple, but effective gym, free water in room, free fridge, free breakfast...make your own waffles too! We had to change rooms because it the first one smelled terribly of smoke, its a smoke free hotel, but obviously someone didnt care-not the hotel's fault.

The downtown Aquarium has rides and carnival games and is a great place to spend an evening. Right across the street from the Aquarium is Hard Rock Cafe and my 10 year old who loves Guitar Hero really enjoyed this. The hotel is not walking distance to the game, but the price and quality of service by far made up for having to drive 5 whole minutes. The hotel does offer shuttle, but we have not taken advantage of it. The hotel breakfast was perfect and had plenty of food available. We brought drinks and food to keep in our in room fridge so it was perfect. They have snack and drink machines along with an icecream freezer. Overall, I would totally recommend it to anyone. We had a great stay both times we visted this hotel.',\n",

They have wireless and wired but you will need to bring your own cable or buy it from the front desk ($10).\\nAnother nice feature is the breakfast which is a bit better than some free continental breakfasts including some hot items.\\nMy biggest complaint was that the location is a few blocks away from the main downtown area and there are no nearby places to eat. I got in at supper time and had to call for delivery from a pizza place nearby that had a pretty limited menu.\\nThe indoor pool is quite small and is located right next to a sitting area in the lobby so unless you want to be on display while you swim, it's not really useful.\\nIf I go back to Houston, I'll probably opt for a hotel in the downtown core, and one that has an in-house restaurant.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'A GLOWING REVIEW: Hilton Garden Inn, Energy Corridor.....AMAZING!!!! From the moment I stepped into the hotel, greeted by Debbie Bunn, it was a wonderful experience! ALL the family and friends stayed at the hotel. The Rehearsal Dinner and Cocktail Hour before were perfection! YIPPPEEEE! A business that KNOWS their business and does it to....yep! Perfection!!!! More to say about the Hilton Garden Inn......I delivered 22 baskets to the hotel on Wednesday before the wedding. Family and friends began arriving on Thursday and would arrive all the way through to Saturday afternoon. Each and every person received their basket at check-in AND received the correct basket. (Each basket was made for each family in mind.) We\\'re off to a great start! Then, following my dad\\'s birthday celebration at Texas Land and Cattle (already heard that story, did ya?).....we all went back to the hotel and we took over the bar area, stayed around past the time the bar was to close and the bartender told us...no problem! No Problem....I\\'m sorry, I am just not used to that selfless, customer service oriented behavior....AMAZING!!!!! \\nFriday....family and friends still arriving...hotel handling everything smoothly. Shuttle took family and friends to the mall and picked them up again....and was prompt! I arrived at 3:00 to begin decorating the hall. Jennifer is the event planner for the hotel. Another \"Can Do\" person. How could there possibly be that many GOOD people in one place? The room was set up, Marco was there to run everywhere around the hotel for me, finding everything that I requested....HE should be the CEO of Hilton! That guy is over the top! The room was super fun with all the Texas decorations, and the details were all taken care of by Jennifer, Marco and the hotel staff. The cocktail hour was a hit and the appetizers were excellent! They even set up our own little bar! The Barbeque and all the fixins\\' were superb! People were still talking about it on Saturday! We finally \"let\" Marco and the waitstaff go home about 10:30. They never complained! Just said it was a wonderful event! THE ENTIRE NIGHT AMAZING!!!! THEY WERE AMAZING!!! Once again, we all stayed at the hotel bar area and the lounge area for a while longer. Did the bartender complain? Nope! Sure didn\\'t! What is this hotel feeding its staff? Happiness, Loyalty, Appreciation? Maybe....just maybe.....what a novel idea! Saturday night....Wedding is over, all is well at the hotel. Everyone is resting, including my hubby and myself. They comped us a room for Friday and Saturday night, so if we wanted to be with family, we could. Really? Giving us something for nothing....noooooo way! WAY!!!!!!! We got up on Sunday morning, met everyone for breakfast. They gave us the back area, so that we could all be together and then we all broke bread together as family. It was a wonderful ending to a wonderful weekend. I truly am almost in tears thinking about and writing about \"our\" wonderful hotel. They joined my family that weekend. They were as happy and excited for us, as we were. From the bottom of my heart, I thank you Hilton. God\\'s blessings upon each and everyone of you, and much, much success always. YOU DESERVE IT!!!!',\n",

       "  'text': \"We stayed at the Beacon in October for our annual girl's trip to NYC. I'm the trip planner and I always try to find a different area for us to stay in. This year, it was the Upper West Side. My research showed that the Beacon was the best deal for the dates of our trip. October is a very expensive time to come to New York so when I was able to find a 1 bedroom suite for less than 400.00 a night, I made the reservation.\\nThe hotel is in a lovely, residential area of New York. When I win the lottery, that's exactly the area I want to live in! We arrived at the hotel at about 10:00 AM on Friday, Oct.5th after a very long cab ride from LGA. Note to self- don't plan our next trip to NYC to arrive during rush hour. Lucky for us, our room was ready when we checked in. The manager on duty was David. He took such good care of us during our stay. This was our 8th annual girl's trip to NYC and as I mentioned we always stay in a different area. The service at this hotel was the best we've ever experienced.\\nThe suite was lovely. Our room was on the 20th floor with a beautiful view of the city. The queen bed was so comfortable and the living area had a pull-out couch and a roll-a-way was sent up for us, which was a nice touch. Loved the fully stocked kitchen. The hotel has been renovated recently and our suite was immaculate. One of my favorite things was having a delicious cup of coffee each morning. There is a Fairway market directly across the street and a wine store next door. Very convenient!\\nWe had a wonderful trip to NYC as always. Had tickets for the Kelly and Michael show, Jimmy Fallon, Huckabee, and saw an Off-Broadway show, Cougar the Musical. Walked the entire High Line at night, went to Chelsea Market, shopping at Macy's,and had some great pizza in Soho just to name a few of the highlights.\\nPlanning another trip to this great city in January, with my husband this time. This will be my birthday trip. I love this city so much. It truly is addicting!\",\n",

Location is good but a little out of the way of major attractions. Rooms are spacious and provide a small kitchenette (which we never used).

The breakfast place right in the same building (but apparently under independent management) is competently run and offers hearty and healthy choices. Staff were helpful.

       "  'text': 'I took my daughter to New York for a 2 night trip. We stayed at the Andaz using Hyatt points and she thought it was the best hotel she ever stayed in, and I have to agree. We were greeted immediatelyin the lobby with a warm hello and offer of a beverage. Checkin was smooth and since we were just a few minutes early we had to waitfor just a few minuteswhile the hostess checked with housekeeping to ensure our room was ready. We waited in a comfortable area just off the lobby and discovered a nook with 5 full shelves of hardcover novels to borrow during our stay. We were escorted to our room and the staff took time to walk us through the cool features of our \"space\" including touchpad light switches, shower with 3 options (footbath, rainhead or handheld) and the nicest bath sheet towels to wrap up in. The blackout shades would roll down with a touch of a button and we were lucky enough to have a small kitchenette area that included a fridge, freezer,microwave and mini coffee maker that made a nice cup of espresso. This area was stcked with soda and other drinks, I enjoyed the large bottle of organic green tea and my teen loved the fizzy organic soda, the Cocacola was just not as cool! In addition there were kettle cooked potato chips, a dark chocolate bar and one of the most delicious granola bars I\\'ve ever had. I saved the package so I can research them on line and order from this local N Y manufacturer. The best part is these snacks are that they are free and replenished each day. In addition,if you visit the lobby there is always coffee, tea, fruit and even wine at a nightly 6pm reception. Prior to our stay the hotel sent an email reminding me of our upcoming stay and asked if there was anything they ould do to make our tay more comfortable. I did respond and let them know we were there to celebrate my daughters birthday- on Friday there was a knock on our door and compliments of the hotel a beautiful piece of chocolate cake arrived with a personalized birthday card wishing her a happy day. All these touches made us feel welcomed and at home during our stay. After a hectic day of touring and running around we splurged on room service at 11pm (the hot dog from a street vendor at 5 was just NOT dinner, but shopping was her 16 yr old focus). The room service staff was courteous, eager to please and prompt. The Andaz is a great value for the money and I do p,an to return, it would ake a great trip with my husband as the hotel has a great bar (whichi was not able to visit this trip) and a nice location. Across from the New York Public Library and only 2 blocks from Times Square one way and 2 blocks fromGrand Central Station in the other direction the hotel makes a great homebase for exploring NYC.',\n",

       "  'text': \"This hotel has a very understated exterior. The subtle signage makes the building blend into the block. You really have to be looking for the hotel to know that it is there and once you are arrive it is not entirely clear as to where you enter. You enter the hotel into a very small lobby. Off to the right of the lobby is a nice seating area that I think the Andaz refers to as the Library. To the right of the lobby are bar height tables and chairs . Eight of us ended up gathering here for complimentary wine during Happy Hour. We checked in around 3pm and our rooms were still not ready. This was a little disappointing since I had requested an early check in but in their defense I was told that they were fully booked the previous evening. \\nUnlike traditional Hyatt's where there are clearly defined roles (i.e.. concierge, bellman, reception, etc.) the Andaz seems to employ generalists. The same person that checked me in also stored my bags, brought the luggage to my suite and later served us wine in the lobby. The staff goes out of their way to remember your name and did greet us personally several times throughout our visit. This was very impressive\\nThe suite was of decent size by NYC standards and had modern decor. The room had a small fridge, microwave and even a dishwasher that were all concealed behind modern cabinetry. The Andaz provides a small quantity of complimentary snacks and beverages in the room. The living area had a very comfortable couch that folded out into an amazingly comfortable sleeper. The high quality King size mattress and high thread count linens made for a comfortable nights sleep. The bathroom is probably the highlight of the accommodations. The walk in rain shower provided seemingly endless hot water. \\nI have read some reviews that suggested that this might not be the most ideal location for families. In general I would agree but did notice that there were a number of travelers accompanied by well mannered children. We had our kids with us and they enjoyed the stay. Outside of the room itself there really isn't anything onsite that children would be drawn to but we were there to tour the city. \\nThe restaurant is very small for a hotel of this size. We had to wait about 10 min for a table for breakfast. The food is tasty, locally sourced (in some cases) and very fresh. This property does not have a Regency Club and as such offers Diamond status guests a $75 food credit each day. This sounds like a lot but and is very generous but keep in mind $75 will likely feed 2 at breakfast. \\nIf you are looking for a grand lobby or a wide array of activities this is not the place for you. If you enjoy a modern vibe and enjoy personalized attention this is the place for you. Upon departure, the staff offered a small complimentary gift\",\n",

Price( great deal on last minute travel) \\nWe were traveling with another couple, and I am always the trip planner. \\nWe were not disappointed. I am sure we had the lowest grade rooms yet they were nice size, probably large for NYC, no view, only another building. The hotel, rooms and bathrooms were all extremely clean. The beds were very comfortable. The rooms were very quiet. The staff was very friendly and helpful. \\nI thought it was an exceptional item to have no set check-in-check-out times. I’m sure if they are super full they can not always accommodate, but we arrived at 1pm and were able to go to our rooms and had a late flight on our last day and were able to check out at 3. \\nAdditionally we received breakfast coupons upon arrival that I was unaware of! Had 3 great breakfasts in their dining room the days we were there, but they do have a very limited menu. \\nWe had drinks 2 nights in the hotel bar and while pricy it was a comfortable atmosphere. Great friendly servers. \\nThe only minor issue was our friends bathroom, they had absolutely no counter space, just a sink on a wall Room 919. Our rooms were identical, but we had a nice long marble counter in our bathroom - Room 719. It was odd. Maybe theirs was a handicap room, but if it was I have no idea how a handicapped person could get in/out of the deep tub! When calling to confirm our reservations the day before we came I did mention it was their 30th anniversary. I felt bad they got that bathroom, but not a huge deal, but if you want a counter in your bathroom don’t stay in room 919. \\nAll in all, great stay, lovely hotel.',\n",

We had dinner served there by the Lambs Club (downstairs), and Chef Z delivered a perfect meal---the delmonico steak and everything else was superb, and enjoying it privately was fabulous! \\nNow to the room and hotel: The greeting starts your visit magnificently. The front desk is friendly, professional and very helpful, 24 hours a day. The lobby itself feels like a 1940\\'s cruise ship, right down to the uniforms worn by the service staff. The fittings are first class----exceptionally clean and tidy throughout.\\nThe room is also exceptional, with a hand made mattress that feels like heaven, the finest linens, a great tv, and a thoroughly first-class experience is assured. You even have a butler, a very friendly fellow who offers to iron your clothes, and cause anything you need to happen almost instantly. We had brought our own bottle of Veuve, and they gladly set it up for us, as if we were in a restaurant. This is a very guest-oriented hotel. I was addressed by name by everyone there!\\nNegatives: too much frivolous technology. It would be nice to have a normal light switch rather than a gadegeted up bathroom switch that operates 4 different functions, if only you could figure them out in the dark. Likewise with the climate control, which you operate via a screen on the telephone. It\\'s all pretty silly to me, and makes simple things far more complicated. Even the toilet is high-tech.....it plugs in to the wall, and you can press buttons on yet another controller---that indicate \"wash front\" \"wash back\" and even \"dry.\" \\nMy only other grip is the door staff, who spend more time on their phones and chatting with each other than paying attention to actually opening the doors for guests.\\nAside from that, this hotel hits homeruns on every front. It\\'s a very upscale experience that is rewarding in every way. My new fave in the city!',\n",

Seeing as we made the booking quite a while in advance, I somehow figured they'd be able to accomodate us.\\nWe brought our pet with us after having filled the pet registration form they require on their website in addition to emailing them prior to again specify we're bringing our pet. Upon arrival though, they claimed to not have received any notification of us bringing a pet. It wasn't a problem as they just had a bed sent up (like i say the staff is super nice).\\nThe room: we had an executive suite. It's nice but like many pple had mentionned in their reviews, it does feels pretty small and cramped and a little dark. some of the wood on the floor is a little worn (scratches..) the bed is great though, but it's not a king. The bathroom is very nice.\\nRoom service: lovely service, decent food.\\nLocation: not bad, close enough to 34th st shopping, decent distance from times square...we are big walkers so it wasn't a problem for us.\\nOverall, we really did like it alot..but now that I've tried it, I think I'd go back to the intercontinental rather than this one (might be a bit more impersonal but the views are amazing, the windows are bigger, and the rooms feel airier and less cramped.)\\nStill, would I recommend this hotel to friends? yes, especially if you have a pet..it's really what sets them apart, you feel like your pet is welcomed and not just tolerated. so thumbs up to Eventi for that. :)\\nI have to say the slight disappointment probably stems from the fact that this hotel has such amazing reviews, better than many others, that I figured it would be nothing short of awesome. instead it was very good, not awesome...:) still a thumbs up to the wonderful staff.

It is not overly large, but not small either. I would describe it as a good standard but not extraordinary.\\nStaff was both great and a bit of a miss. The concierge and the bell boys went above and beyond in helping us and really did a great job. I would recommend talking to them about restaurants, air port transfer, shopping etc. Though the fornt desk staff was more of a miss. They felt clueless in several requests and gave contradictory answers and did not feel that professional or knowledgable.\\nDuring our stay both the restaurant and the bar was being refurbished, something we were not notified of beforehand. And the breakfast was instead a box collected at the front desk consisting of yoghurt, a croissant and a banana. It was sufficient, but perhaps not something I would expect from a hotel such as this.\\nIn summary, it is perfectly located and provides a good nights sleep. But it did not provide me with that feeling of a place that goes above and beyond, though the bell boys certainly do!',\n",

Bathroom was small but functional. Breakfast was included but I didn't try it - looked like the usual continental buffet. My only hesitation in recommending this hotel is a very limited room service menu that comes from the Indian restaurant next door. The food was pedestrian and the delivery person hit me up for a tip in cash- a rather odd exchange. No silverware came with the meal - the idea was to use the silver from the kitchen but then plates and silver stayed until the next morning. Otherwise, my stay was good and I would go back.

They were invariably friendly, extremely helpful, and very very efficient. When i asked the concierge about the Houston metro rail, the man ( nice ostich boots, by the way) all but led me by the hand to the appropriate stop. Erica at the front desk ( who obviously has her own Tripsdvisor fan club) lived up to her advance press and simultaneously provided information, arranged a favor for me and ooohed over pictures of my grandsons. All of the staff were just that awesome. The reason for my visit was a small grandson's surgery. After long frightening stressful days at the hospital, the Hotel Icon was a peaceful and uplifting retreat. I will always stay here, if possible, whenever I visit Houston.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'My husband and I traveled to Houston for a conference and were delighted upon check-in to hear we had been upgraded to a suite in the Four Seasons Residences. We were ushered into a separate check-in area and quickly shown to our spacious and elegant apartment which featured a fully equipped galley kitchen, living room with dining table, bedroom and bathroom. While we would never have splurged to upgrade ourselves, it was a wonderful perk. The hotel is older, perhaps a bit dated (could be considered \"classic\"), but seems to be well kept up. The service was exceptional: we enjoyed complimentary newspapers, coffee and delicious breakfast pastries each morning in the Residence\\'s lobby and appreciated all the advice and help with dinner reservations from the concierge. The valet at the main hotel lobby was extremely accommodating and arranged to have the hotel\\'s car and driver take us to a conference event that was a few miles away. One of the highlights of our stay was the Tuesday evening wine tasting event in the Four Seasons wine bar, Vinoteca. We enjoyed four or five generous pours of excellent Italian wines and when my husband remarked that he particularly liked one of them, the waitress came and poured him a full glass! When we returned home we we looked up the wine he had liked so much and found it to be a bottle that sells for $85! There was also a delicious buffet of Italian cheese and fruits and crackers to accompany the wine. Very, very enjoyable! I walked through the smallish pool area and it would have been inviting if not for the stifling heat (well over a hundred.) The one downside to our stay: it always aggravates me to have to pay extra for internet access and the Four Seasons charges a daily fee for internet.\\nThe comfortable accommodations were especially appreciated when we left the hotel to find the downtown area highly depressing: soulless architecture, somewhat desolate and grungy, and full of panhandlers. We were not 20 feet from the hotel when we were approached by a man claiming to have car trouble and looking for a handout. We took the light rail out to the museum area and Rice University just to look around and get the lay of the land but the extreme heat in June did not allow us to explore much. We ended up taking the downtown underground tunnels back toward the hotel to get out of the heat and noted very few open businesses and lots of closed/empty storefronts. Houston\\'s downtown seems to have seen better times. Two enjoyable places nearby: The Grove for dinner and cocktails was fun and Phoenicia Specialty Foods is fun to explore (a middle eastern market cafe) and the salads and sandwiches we tried were delicious.',\n",

We made a ten minute call to a landline (our bank) in the UK and were charged $149!!!! And $60 and $80 for two 5 minute calls to Australia. Furthermore, when we asked for more information on the call bill (they gave us the time, not the duration of the calls), the man at reception got quite annoyed and basically implied that we must be idiots if we can't see that the international calls are what cost so much (yes...! but can you tell us how you got to the cost please? the duration?? the rate???). No matter what we said, he just kept saying that it was all written on the bill (on the bill was actually the time of the calls, written in 24 hour time) and the rate is whatever unknown rate they are charged (probably using gold cables being exchanged through luxembourg) plus 75% and scoffing and waving the bill away. He would have clearly seen this was not the case if he'd chosen to listen to us rather than scoffing at our stupidity and gesturing to talk to the hand. Absolutely get a phone card even if, like us, you have no intention of making calls anyway. Or, just use your foreign mobile, its actually WAY cheaper. You never know when your bank might freak out over security and cancel your cards or someone at home has an urgent problem.\\nThat aside, this hotel is pretty good for a middle of the road place in NYC. We stayed with our two young children, aged 2 and 3 years old and the location is fantastic. You can easily walk to loads of child-friendly attractions including the children's museum, the natural history museum, central park and even the Met by walking through the park. All the museums and galleries also run children's programming so there's even more to them than just looking at the exhibits.\\nThe kitchens were VERY basically supplied so even though they say that you have a full kitchen, you can't really cook much. There are no dishes/pans suitable for the oven so its completely redundant. There are also no dishes suitable for cooking food in the microwave... except maybe 4 small plates, 4 dinner plates and 4 shallow cereal bowls. I suppose you could heat a TV dinner in the packaging it comes in or heat baby food etc, otherwise you're completely limited to what you can produce on the stove with a small frypan, one spatula and one small saucepan.\\nThe hotel suggests that you contact the Babysitters Guild direct for babysitting services, which we did and we absolutely loved our sitter whose name was Amy.\\nThe doormen are lovely and will receive parcels for you if you shop up a storm and need to have things delivered.\\nThere is a very handy coin-operated laundry room on one of the floors which costs $1.75 for each box of detergent, wash or dry load.\\nThe rooms are small but furnished nicely. There are pretty good restaurants nearby and the supermarket across the road is conveniently open until 1am.\\nThere is good, free wifi in the rooms and a printer and computer for guest use on the ground floor.\",\n",

The personal attention is something that they have figured out pretty well. Always someone to greet you and make you feel at home. There are casual uniforms and they want you feel as if they are your friends. I was told that management wears a tie, they the” front line” do not.\\nWow, what a novel idea everything other than alcohol products are free in your room refrigerator. No longer do you have that obstacle in your room that you must avoid at all costs. Liquid wise you had a few choices, food was either potato chips or a granola bar that was it. Still better than nothing. Wi-Fi was included as it should be in all hotels.\\nTwo Mediocre, I am a 65 year old male that suffers from sleep apnea. I have a cpap machine and I use it religiously. In a cpap machine you are supposed to use distilled water. Three out four people I talked to in the hotel did not know what distilled water was. Finally I did assure myself that they did not have any and I would have to find some myself. I walked to two Duane Reade Drugs stores that had no distilled water and finally had to go to a Walgreens in Times Square. I forgive you for not having it but please tell me where I can purchase some. I did attempt to call the hotel manager, not because I was upset but I thought that he should know the operator trying to protect the manager gave me the voice mail of his number two. Not good! You too should not have a tie.\\nA $75 breakfast was included with our reservation. Hard to believe $75, but again it was New York and I think an omelet was $17. On our last day we checked out early so they could get the room ready for the next reservation, even though we had about two hours until check out time and when we needed to leave. When I got home I looked at our credit card statement and found $89 charged to our bill for breakfast. $14 above the allowed $75, first how could that be and second why was this not included. We checked out to do the hotel as a favor and now I was being billed for breakfast. I called the hotel a couple of times and the staff were very courteous and took care of this problem.\\nThere is “no free lunch,” the Wi Fi took me about 20 minutes to hooked up to when we checked in and later in the week (we spent five nights) I had to call there service once again.\\nThe showers which the staff was very proud of, actually scared me. At 65 I am not as agile as I would like. The shower is large and I was fearful of slipping and falling. I do not want a handicapped room , but I think the shower could use a couple of safety bars.\\nYes I would most likely stay again, if I had the daily room rate, but there are many choice in and below there price range to choose from.',\n",

       "  'text': \"First time at this Hyatt property, as a Diamond HGP, received an upgraded suite... it was a massive hotel room... separate living room, sleeping area, hallway with with a lot of closets, and huge bathroom. Included a 'pantry' area with microwave, sink, near full size refrigerator (all items comp except for beer and liquor), and nepresso coffee machine. A few quirks though in this room... the light controls were 'touch pads' and aside from being senstive to the touch (turning lights on/off that we didn't want), the control pad for the bath room was in the hallway, which meant hunting down the halllway in the dark to find it, press it and peeking into the bathroom to find out if on or not (w/o bathing the sleeping area in light). Also, there is no door between the WC and the rest of the bathroom... so when one of us had to use the loo, the other had to leave the bathroom (did i mention that the bathroom is huge, so in theory, more than one person should be able to use at once). As a note, no newspaper is delivered to the room (which was odd as when i was walked to the room by someone from the staff, they asked me for my newspaper preference). Wonderful location if one wants to spend time in mid-town, which is exactly what we wanted to do.\",\n",

We were only going to be in town a couple of nights and we were going to 2 shows. So, she felt the location would be perfect. We checked in easily and found the small lobby charming and the 2 women at the front desk delightful. The lobby bar is at the other end of the lobby as is the restaurant. Another lounge is located up the stairs on the second floor. We were taken to our room by an enthusiastic bellman who showed us how everything worked in our room - including our Japanese toilet with the heated seat! The room was small - it is New York after all - but luxurious and immaculate. The walls are covered in mocha suede. We had ample closet space and a terrace with a table, chairs and a large canvas umbrella. The bathroom is luxurious. The hotel spa is a satellite location of the famous Red Door Spa by Elizabeth Arden. I had a superb facial as my husband worked out in the adjoining exercise room. They also have a resistance pool. The staff is as friendly and professional as the rest of the hotel. The food in the hotel was delicious, the drinks and servers in the lounge were wonderful! You are less than 2 blocks from Times Square which makes Broadway an easy walk. But as close as this hotel is to the hustle and bustle of Times Square, it is a oasis of calm and sophistication in this hectic city. It will be our go to hotel from now on.',\n",

One member of our party participated in a conference at a hotel 2 blocks away near Madison Square Garden. We chose to stay at the Eventi because there was a labour dispute at the hotel hosting the conference and we had also read about bed bugs at that particular property.\\nThe staff was very polite and welcoming. The doormen handled our luggage with care and made sure we had an easy check-in. The lobby is small, but average by New York standards, but very lively and trendy.\\nOur suite was uniquely and tastefully decorated. Everything about the room was very nice, but small, understandable in Manhattan, but still small. The only thing that was spacious was the bathroom. The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. The sofa bed was great for the teenager.\\nSome downsides to the hotel were room service. Room service seemed slow. The staff was also slow to remove tables and trays from the room. The location was good for the conference, but the Garment District can be very gritty, even by New York standards. Trash piles up on side streets and most of the surrounding buildings are active warehouses. Lastly, the bathrooms in the suites feature a barn style door on sliders. This very heavy barn door became derailed and trapped two members of our party in the bathroom for several minutes, while the third member of our party was out of the room. Beauty and practicality must come together.\\nThe hotel's pricing is about average for New York.\\nI recommend this hotel if this is your desired location.\",\n",

For the price alone, I think we got what we paid for. \\nThe positives: The location is central and it's easy to get anywhere in Manhattan fairly quickly. The rooms are well designed for the size and had a really comfortable, white duvet bed, large flat screen TV, mini bar, safe, desk and two chairs. The decent sized marble bathroom featured a wide vanity and a large shower with teak seat and Etro toiletries. Floor to ceiling windows even had a look-up-to-the-left view of the Empire State Building. Housekeeping twice a day was great and scheduled around us without issue. \\nThe negatives: Our room was not ready, which isn't totally inconceivable at 1:00, but the desk attendant didn't seem the least bit welcoming or concerned about our inconvenience--especially since we arrived during a rain storm. First impressions are the most important and I guess we got off to a bad start. Other staff members were friendlier. The hotel decor is comprised of dark grays, black and browns which gave off a dingy vibe in some areas. Lack of sufficient lighting in the room compounded the problem. While the guest room and bathroom were of ample size, the closet was too shallow to hang clothes without having to squeeze them in at an angle or to store a full suitcase. \\nOther than a few gripes, I would consider staying here again if the price is right and I needed to be in this part of town.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"This was an adequate stay for a reasonable price.\\nThe hotel is well situated on E 50th; across the street are both the Benjamin and Affinia 50, so others might want to try them for comparison.\\nThere's nothing special about the property. The reception lounge is relatively small yet efficient. The executive room I took was ok, decent space, comfortable sofa and chairs, workable kitchen facilities - but not of a quality of a place like the Alex. Bathroom was small yet functional - ok water pressure and Aveda giveaways. Bed quality was fine.\\nTwo gripes were the towels and the continental breakfast. The towels were so worn and thin that I thought their sandpaper-like quality might exfoliate my entire body without ever really drying it. Really, it was like a bad summer camp experience. And the continental breakfast was bland, cheap in quality and tasteless. The hotel management must have someone specifically picking up months supplies of huge quantities of nourishment at BJs or Walmart.\\nSo, if you want that location (50th and 3rd) for a decent night's sleep, grab a discounted rate and avoid the breakfast. It's a decent enough place for a night or two (p.s. go get a breakfast bagel at Ess-A-Bagel and coffee across the street and don't even try to justify the embedded continental breakfast cost).\",\n",

We have stayed near Time Square in the past but wanted something less crazy and this place met our expectations. Also a short walk to Metropolitan Museum and You can pick up hop on hop off sightseeing buses, take carriage ride a block away from hotel.

Once the party started and dinner was served everyone was even more thrilled to see the different choices in the buffet line, set up with so many choices of fresh and luscious foods. \\nOur decorations were so elegant, and all the details I myself wanted such as little surprises through the night, or the way I wanted things to look, colors, chair covers, cake table, gift table, favors for guests, announcements, even our picture and sign table etc… where done exactly as I had asked them. Having our wedding there was hassle free and with less planning from our part. \\nEveryone at the hotel was so friendly and we look forward to spending our next anniversary there as we can assure the next morning’s breakfast after our wedding reception was so DELICOUS we didn’t want to leave. \\nAs for the hotel itself, it is beautiful, it smells still like new, the rooms are comfortable, the bathrooms close to the wedding reception were kept neat and clean, and the floors and decorations were so nice and pleasant to invite anyone to stay there. We also want to mention the nice appearance of the front staff and the waitress/clean crew for looking clean and professional. \\nFinally, we will keep staying at the Hilton family and would like to say one more time thanks to the Hilton Garden Inn for making it possible to have our dream wedding come true!!!\\nLove Diana and Marvin Gonzalez',\n",

We decided to stay at the Westin instead of driving the 3-hours from San Antonio and back in one day. The welcome was spectacular; the reception persons provided service above what I would call normal greetings and assurances that our stay would be memorable. The hotel was situated comfortably in Houston, making easy on and off I-10. The guest room was roomy, clean and welcoming. The shower was very relaxing-with a rain shower head. The bed was very comfortable; and, I'm very particular. The Grille 024 restaurant provided a good breakfast buffet, but the servers went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable. I found the hotel experience very nice. Generally, my wife and I stay at Bed & Breakfast establishments because we enjoy our comfort. However, the Westin made us feel just at home as most B&B's. Coming to or driving through Houston-the Weston is worth the stop.\",\n",

The hotel is connected to the mall which is a nice feature and very convienent to grad something to eat or pick up something you forgot at Target. \\nThe only negatives were that my room faced the free-way which was very noisey.

Staff was helpful and nice. There was a neat waterfall in the bar. The pool patio gets a decent amount of sun late morning/early afternoon, but after that it\\'s all shaded - not the best for sunbathers. \\nI don\\'t agree with having to pay for parking at the hotel since it\\'s in a residential area. I would understand if the hotel was in downtown or a densely populated area, but not when it\\'s out in the \"suburb.\" I hope the hotel rethinks it\\'s $12/night parking fee - should be free for guests - or at least a perk for us SPG members.\\nOverall - I will return and recommend Westin!',\n",

I guess if your not with them, you really don't want to play with them. Normally, I'd be up for shenanigans, but we were tired. If the swank, party city scene is yours, this would be a viable choice. The hotel is located within walking distance to a wine tasting bar/restaurant and a brewhouse with hundred's of fresh brews from around the world to choose from. We woke up every morning to some activity blasting in the city center (yoga and spinning classes). The rooms were modern and clean. Walk-in shower that's legit, no toilet/sink/shower privacy. The lights were a little dazed and confusing and almost felt prison-like. Overall, not a bad place for those seeking great restaurants, activities, and a Vegas scene minus the gambling. It really is in the city center.\",\n",

The following day we did not receive housekeeping service and by 5:00 had to request service twice. The front desk staff apologized and we were suprised when a bottle of wine arrived with apologies for the inconvenience. The continental breakfast is average and the lounge was suprisingly dirty both mornings we ate there. The furniture in corridor leading to lobby is shabby. Bathroom is very small and cleaning was spotty. On a positive note, the location of hotel is near great restaurants, shopping, spa and movie theatre.

The rate was moderate, but you get a lot more for your money than most similarly priced hotels. Lots of great restaurants close (not to mention the Museum of Natural History & Central Park).

The standard King room was small and cozy - typical for NYC, but the windows were huge and our room faced the library. Beautiful view. There are suites available, but the standard room suited us just fine. This is not your typical Hyatt-it is more like a boutiquE hotel. The whole property is VERY quiet, the staff is helpful yet subtle, the decor is soothing, sleek, modern and minimalistic. The Bar Downstairs was very hip and the food was delicious. The bathroom was very large-the best feature was the extra large shower. Tile and glass with foot bath, handheld shower and rain shower features! My only complaint, if it can even be called a complaint, is that the lighting in the bathroom was a bit too dim. This is by far one of the best Hyatt we have stayed at, and since we are Diamond members, we stay at a lot of Hyatts.

All of the things I've grown used to from Kimpton. We stayed in a suite (pricey) and it was everything I was hoping for. The bedroom was well appointed, perfectly lit, amazing bed. The bathroom was the highlight...this is not your normal NYC bathroom or room for that matter. It was spacious and the shower was simply perfect. We were in a high enough floor that I didn't hear any noise. This is a real treat as anyone whose ever stayed in NY know that the traffic noise can be annoying while you try to sleep.\\nI also loved my yoga bag, being able to use their gym and the great products in the bathroom. I wish I had taken photos as the room was just as attractive as the photos on their site. My only issue was that the hotel is not really in Chelsea (or if it is it's on the border) but closer to Herald Square. I was looking to walk to great restaurants and bars but really they weren't in that area. Chelsea's best spots are south of 24th and this was at 30th St. Still you are close to the subway which was great and walking in NYC is part of the fun. Kimpton...please keep up the great work.

       "  'text': \"This is my 3rd trip to the Eventi. As a (somewhat disgruntled ) Starwood Platinum member, I have been giving Kimpton a serious try. Most of their hotels are wonderful. Eventi just does not make the grade. The staff for the most part are very gracious. But something is always just not quite right here. My first visit they had some sort of water pipe break which flooded some guest rooms. They gallantly and apologetically put me on a steeper sofa for the night. OK, stuff happens--I understand. The next trip here they somehow cancelled my room--yes I was late, but I had told them I would be late, but they did get me a room and sent a very nice amenity to the room. I kind of decided this one would be chalked up to my fault: I was late arriving. The third visit started out great. An upgrade to a suite by a wonderfully gracious friendly welcome staff. I get to my floor and there are dirty room service trays everywhere. This is at 4:15 PM. One has to order ice here from room service. 25 minutes later and 3 calls it finally arrives. When I complained there was an excuse about the ice has to come from the resturant. I asked if the NYC garbage collection department was responsible for collecting half day old room service litter in the hallways, and asked for the general manager to call me. Yes- I admit my happiness with the suite upgrade had faded now in the face of inattentive service. \\nSo my advice: great location, very friendly staff, nice rooms, but the attention to detail leaves a bit to be desired. My experience here makes me re-think my plan to leave Starwood for Kimpton, but I have to admit other Kimpton properties have been quite wonderful. If the kind of issues I've described don't bother you much, then you will probably like Eventi quite a lot.\",\n",

We became AirBnB hosts in 2014 and have since hosted more than 2,000 bookings. In 2018, we became AirBnB superhosts!\\n\\nWe live in Asheville in the beautiful mountains of western North Carolina.\\n\\nAllison works as a fourth grade teacher at Mills River Elementary School. Peter works as the Trails Coordinator at a regional land trust, Conserving Carolina. Both of us work to keep this region we love as wonderful as it is today, and make it even better for future generations.\\n\\nWe love to take road trips throughout the year. We have appreciated the kindness of many over the years who have let us stay in their home or camp in their yard, or have rented a room to us for a reasonable rate. We are guests who are focused on our travels and we most often are seeking simply a room to hang our hat for the night before our travels resume the following morning. For that reason, most hosts barely know that we are there. In appreciation for the kindness shown to us over the years, we pay it forward by being clean and courteous when we are guests in the homes of others, and we are seeking to host guests who are similarly self-sufficient and simply seeking a basic place for the night.\\n\\nWe look forward to you staying in our home!',\n",

In 2018, we became AirBnB superhosts!\\n\\nWe live in Asheville in the beautiful mountains of western North Carolina.\\n\\nAllison works as a fourth grade teacher at Mills River Elementary School. Peter works as the Trails Coordinator at a regional land trust, Conserving Carolina. Both of us work to keep this region we love as wonderful as it is today, and make it even better for future generations.\\n\\nWe love to take road trips throughout the year. We have appreciated the kindness of many over the years who have let us stay in their home or camp in their yard, or have rented a room to us for a reasonable rate. We are guests who are focused on our travels and we most often are seeking simply a room to hang our hat for the night before our travels resume the following morning. For that reason, most hosts barely know that we are there. In appreciation for the kindness shown to us over the years, we pay it forward by being clean and courteous when we are guests in the homes of others, and we are seeking to host guests who are similarly self-sufficient and simply seeking a basic place for the night.\\n\\nWe look forward to you staying in our home!',\n",

Our room was on the 20th floor overlooking Broadway and the madhouse of the Fairway Market. Room was quite with no noise evident from the hallway or adjoining rooms. It was great to be able to open windows when we craved fresh rather than heated air. The beds, including the fold out sofa bed, were comfortable and the rooms were cleaned well. Wi-fi access worked like a dream with only one connectivity issue on our first night and this was promptly responded to with a call from the service provider to ensure that all was well. The location close to the 72nd Street subway station is great and the complimentary umbrellas on the drizzly days were greatly appreciated. It is fabulous to have the kitchen with cooking facilities and the access to a whole range of fresh foods directly across the road at Fairway.\\nThis is the second time that members of the party have stayed at the Beacon and it will certainly be our hotel of choice for future visits.',\n",
